  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s not a stretch to suggest that when we disagree with other people, we often regard them as being irrational. Kevin Dorst PhD ’19 has developed a body of research with surprising things to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorst, an associate professor of philosophy at MIT, studies rationality: how we apply it, or think we do, and how that bears out in society. The goal is to help us think clearly and perhaps with fresh eyes about something we may take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout his work, Dorst specializes in exploring the nuances of rationality. To take just one instance, consider how ambiguity can interact with rationality. Suppose there are two studies about the effect of a new housing subdivision on local traffic patterns: One shows there will be a substantial increase in traffic, and one shows a minor effect. Even if both studies are sound in their methods and data, neither may have a totally airtight case. People who regard themselves as rationally assessing the numbers will likely disagree about which is most valid, and — though this may not be entirely rational — may use their prior beliefs to poke holes in the study that does not represent their prior beliefs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other things, this process also calls into question the widespread “Bayesian” conception that people’s views shift and come into alignment as they’re presented with new evidence. It may be that instead, people apply rationality while their views diverge, not converge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also the kind of phenomenon Dorst explores in the paper “Rational Polarization,” published in &lt;em&gt;The Philosophical Review&lt;/em&gt; in 2023; currently Dorst is working on a book about how people can take rational approaches but still wind up with different conclusions about the world. Dorst combines careful argumentation, mathematically structured descriptions of thinking, and even experimental evidence about cognition and people’s views, an increasing trend in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s something freeing about how methodologically open philosophy is,”&amp;nbsp;says Dorst, a good-humored and genial conversationalist. “A question can be philosophical if it’s important and we don’t yet have settled methods for answering it, because in philosophy it’s always okay to ask what methods we should be using. It’s one of the exciting things about philosophy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his research and teaching, Dorst was awarded tenure at MIT last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show me your work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorst grew up in Missouri, not exactly expecting to become a philosopher, but he started following in the academic trail of his older brother, who had become interested in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t know what philosophy was growing up, but once my brother started getting interested, there was a little bootstrapping, egging each other on, and having someone to talk to,” Dorst says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis, Dorst majored in philosophy and political science. By graduation, he had become sold on studying philosophy full-time, and was accepted into MIT’s program as a doctoral student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Institute, he started specializing in the problems he now studies full-time, about how we know things and how much we are thinking rationally, while working with Roger White as his primary adviser, along with faculty members Robert Stalnaker and Kieran Setiya of MIT and Branden Fitelson of Northeastern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After earning his PhD, Dorst spent a year as a fellow at Oxford University’s Magdalen College, then joined faculty of the University of Pittsburgh. He returned to MIT, this time on the faculty, in 2022. Now settled in the MIT philosophy faculty, Dorst tries to continue the department’s tradition of engaged teaching with his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They wrestle like everyone does with the conceptual and philosophical questions, but the speed with which you can get through technical things in a course is astounding,” Dorst says of MIT undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New methods, time-honored issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present Dorst, who has published widely in philosophy journals, is grinding through the process of writing a book manuscript about the complexity of rationality. Chapter subjects include hindsight bias, confirmation bias, overconfidence, and polarization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the process, Dorst is also developing and conducting more experiments than ever before, to look at the way people process information and regard themselves as being rational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s this whole movement of experimental philosophy, using experimental data, being sensitive to cognitive science and being interested in connecting questions we have to it,” Dorst says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his case, he adds, “The big picture is trying to connect the theoretical work on rationality with the more empirical work about what leads to polarization,” he says. The salience of the work, meanwhile, applies to a wide range of subjects:&amp;nbsp; “People have been polarized forever over everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he explains all of this, Dorst looks up at the whiteboard in his office, where an extensive set of equations represents the output of some experiments and his ongoing effort to comprehend the results, as part of the book project. When he finishes, he hopes to have work broadly useful in philosophy, cognitive science, and other fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We might use some different models in philosophy,” he says, “but let’s all try to figure out how people process information and regard arguments.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Seven MIT faculty and 21 additional MIT alumni are among 126 early-career researchers honored with &lt;a href="https://sloan.org/fellowships/2025-fellows"&gt;2025 Sloan Research Fellowships&lt;/a&gt; by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The recipients represent the MIT departments of&amp;nbsp;Biology; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry;&amp;nbsp;Civil and Environmental Engineering;&amp;nbsp;Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences; Economics;&amp;nbsp;Electrical Engineering and Computer Science;&amp;nbsp;Mathematics; and Physics as well as the Music and Theater Arts Section and the&amp;nbsp;MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The fellowships honor exceptional researchers at U.S. and Canadian educational institutions, whose creativity, innovation, and research accomplishments make them stand out as the next generation of leaders. Winners receive a two-year, $75,000 fellowship that can be used flexibly to advance the fellow’s research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The Sloan Research Fellows represent the very best of early-career science, embodying the creativity, ambition, and rigor that drive discovery forward,” says Adam F. Falk, president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. “These extraordinary scholars are already making significant contributions, and we are confident they will shape the future of their fields in remarkable ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Including this year’s recipients, a total of 333 MIT faculty have received Sloan Research Fellowships since the program’s inception in 1955. MIT and Northwestern University are tied for having the most faculty in the 2025 cohort of fellows, each with seven. The MIT recipients are:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/ariel-l-furst/"&gt;Ariel L. Furst&lt;/a&gt; is the Paul M. Cook Career Development Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT. Her lab combines biological, chemical, and materials engineering to solve challenges in human health and environmental sustainability, with lab members developing technologies for implementation in low-resource settings to ensure equitable access to technology. Furst completed her PhD in the lab of Professor Jacqueline K. Barton at Caltech developing new cancer diagnostic strategies based on DNA charge transport. She was then an A.O. Beckman Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab of Professor Matthew Francis at the University of California at Berkeley, developing sensors to monitor environmental pollutants. She is the recipient of the NIH New Innovator Award, the NSF CAREER Award, and the Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award. She is passionate about STEM outreach and increasing participation of underrepresented groups in engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/mohsen-ghaffari/"&gt;Mohsen Ghaffari&lt;/a&gt; SM ’13, PhD ’17 is an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) as well as the&amp;nbsp;Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). His research explores the theory of distributed and parallel computation, and he has had influential work on a range of algorithmic problems, including generic derandomization methods for distributed computing and parallel computing (which resolved several decades-old open problems), improved distributed algorithms for graph problems, sublinear algorithms derived via distributed techniques, and algorithmic and impossibility results for massively parallel computation. His work has been recognized with best paper awards at the IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA), ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA), the ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC), and the International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC), the European Research Council's Starting Grant, and a Google Faculty Research Award, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/marzyeh-ghassemi/"&gt;Marzyeh Ghassemi&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’17 is an associate professor within EECS and the&amp;nbsp;Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES). Ghassemi earned two bachelor’s degrees in computer science and electrical engineering from New Mexico State University as a Goldwater Scholar; her MS in biomedical engineering from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar; and her PhD in computer science from MIT. Following stints as a visiting researcher with Alphabet’s Verily and an assistant professor at University of Toronto, Ghassemi joined EECS and IMES as an assistant professor in July 2021. (IMES is the home of the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology.) She is affiliated with the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS),&amp;nbsp;the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab,&amp;nbsp;the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health, the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), and CSAIL. Ghassemi’s research in the Healthy ML Group creates a rigorous quantitative framework in which to design, develop, and place&amp;nbsp;machine learning models in a way that is robust and useful, focusing on health settings. Her contributions range from socially-aware model construction to improving subgroup- and shift-robust learning methods to identifying important insights in model deployment scenarios that have implications in policy, health practice, and equity. Among other awards, Ghassemi has been named one of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 35 Innovators Under 35 and an AI2050 Fellow, as well as receiving the 2018 Seth J. Teller Award, the 2023 MIT Prize for Open Data, a 2024 NSF CAREER Award, and the Google Research Scholar Award. She founded the nonprofit Association for Health, Inference and Learning (AHLI) and her work has been featured in popular press such as &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/darcy-mcrose/"&gt;Darcy McRose&lt;/a&gt; is the Thomas D. and Virginia W. Cabot Career Development Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering. She is an environmental microbiologist who&amp;nbsp;draws on techniques from genetics, chemistry, and geosciences to understand the ways microbes control nutrient cycling and plant health.&amp;nbsp;Her laboratory uses small molecules, or “secondary metabolites,” made by plants and microbes as tractable experiments tools to study microbial activity in complex environments like soils and sediments. In the long term, this work aims to uncover fundamental controls on microbial physiology and community assembly that can be used to promote&amp;nbsp;agricultural sustainability, ecosystem health, and human prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/sarah-millholland/"&gt;Sarah Millholland&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of physics at MIT and member of the&amp;nbsp;Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research,&amp;nbsp;is a theoretical astrophysicist who studies extrasolar planets, including their formation and evolution, orbital dynamics, and interiors/atmospheres. She studies patterns in the observed planetary orbital architectures, referring to properties like the spacings, eccentricities, inclinations, axial tilts, and planetary size relationships. She specializes in investigating how gravitational interactions such as tides, resonances, and spin dynamics sculpt observable exoplanet properties.&amp;nbsp;She is the 2024 recipient of the&amp;nbsp;Vera Rubin Early Career Award for her&amp;nbsp;contributions to the formation and dynamics of extrasolar planetary systems.&amp;nbsp;She plans to use her Sloan Fellowship to explore how tidal physics shape the diversity of orbits and interiors of exoplanets orbiting close to their stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/emil-verner"&gt;Emil Verner&lt;/a&gt; is the Albert F. (1942) and Jeanne P. Clear Career Development Associate Professor of Global Management and an associate professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. His research lies at the intersection of finance and macroeconomics, with a particular focus on understanding the causes and consequences of financial crises over the past 150 years. Verner’s recent work examines the drivers of bank runs and insolvency during banking crises, the role of debt booms in amplifying macroeconomic fluctuations, the effectiveness of debt relief policies during crises, and how financial crises impact political polarization and support for populist parties. Before joining MIT, he earned a PhD in economics from Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/christian-wolf"&gt;Christian Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, the Rudi Dornbusch Career Development Assistant Professor of Economics and a faculty research fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research, works in macroeconomics, monetary economics, and time series econometrics. His work focuses on the development and application of new empirical methods to address classic macroeconomic questions and to evaluate how robust the answers are to a range of common modeling assumptions. His research has provided path-breaking insights on monetary transmission mechanisms and fiscal policy. In a separate strand of work, Wolf has substantially deepened our understanding of the appropriate methods macroeconomists should use to estimate impulse response functions — how key economic variables respond to policy changes or unexpected shocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The following MIT alumni also received fellowships:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Altschuler SM ’18, PhD ’22&lt;br&gt;David Bau III PhD ’21&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Rene Boiteau PhD ’16&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Lynne Chantranupong PhD ’17&lt;br&gt;Lydia B.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A new initiative will offer faculty in the MIT &lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (SHASS) the opportunity to participate in a semester-long internal fellows program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The SHASS Faculty Fellows program, administered by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/human-insight-collaborative/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Human Insight Collaborative&lt;/a&gt; (MITHIC), will provide faculty with time to focus on their research, writing, or artistic production, and to receive collegial support for the same; to foster social and intellectual community within SHASS, including between faculty and students beyond the classroom; and provide informal opportunities to develop intergenerational professional mentorships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“SHASS faculty have been eager for a supportive, vibrant internal community for the nearly 35 years I’ve been at MIT,” says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/anne-e-c-mccants/" target="_blank"&gt;Anne McCants&lt;/a&gt;, the Ann F. Friedlaender Professor of History, and Faculty Fellows Program committee chair. “By providing participants with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://urop.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;UROPs&lt;/a&gt; [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program projects] and other opportunities to interact with students, we’re demonstrating our commitment to fostering an environment in which faculty can recharge and sustain the high-quality teaching and service our community has come to expect and appreciate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The creation of the program was one of the recommendations included in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SHASS_Programming_Initiative_Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;May 2024 SHASS Programming Initiative Report&lt;/a&gt;, an effort led by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/keeril-makan" target="_blank"&gt;Keeril Makan&lt;/a&gt;, SHASS associate dean for strategic initiatives, and the Michael (1949) and Sonja Koerner Music Composition Professor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The inaugural group of fellows for Spring 2026 includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/hector-beltran" target="_blank"&gt;Héctor Beltrán&lt;/a&gt;, Class of 1957 Career Development Associate Professor, MIT Anthropology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/volha-charnysh" target="_blank"&gt;Volha Charnysh&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;Ford Career Development Associate Professor, Department of Political Science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/people/faculty/dorst/" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Dorst&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor, MIT Philosophy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/richard-nielsen" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor, Department of Political Science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/emily-richmond-pollock" target="_blank"&gt;Emily Richmond Pollock&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor, MIT Music&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/jessica-ruffin/" target="_blank"&gt;Jessica Ruffin&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor, MIT Literature&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/robin-scheffler/" target="_blank"&gt;Robin Scheffler&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor, Program in Science, Technology, and Society&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Tenure-line faculty are eligible to apply, with a maximum of 12 members selected per year, or roughly six participants per term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Selected&amp;nbsp;faculty will spend a semester outside the classroom while still holding time for sustained interaction with a small cohort of colleagues. Fellows can work with the dedicated students in UROP&amp;nbsp;to advance&amp;nbsp;their research projects while investing in a unique, cross-disciplinary set of conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I was honored to help design the Fellows Program and to serve on the review committee,” says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/abahr/"&gt;Arthur Bahr&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the Literature Section and a member of the Faculty Fellows Program Selection Committee. “I was fortunate to have wonderful mentors within Literature, but would have loved the opportunity to get to know and learn from colleagues in other fields, which the Fellows Program will offer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“What excites me about the Faculty Fellows Program — beyond the opportunity for faculty to connect with each other across disciplines and units — is that it will spotlight the excellence and centrality of the humanities, arts, and social sciences at MIT,” says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/heather-paxson" target="_blank"&gt;Heather Paxson&lt;/a&gt;, SHASS associate dean for faculty, and the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Anthropology. “I look forward to hearing about new ideas sparked, and new friendships made, through participation in the program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Organizers say the program signals that MIT takes its investment in the humanities, arts and social sciences as seriously as its peer institutions, most of which have internal fellows programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the strong demand for something like this, getting the program up and running is an important signal to SHASS faculty that Dean [Agustín] Rayo hears their concerns and is committed to supporting this type of community development,” McCants notes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Intelligent, caring, inspiring, and full-of-wisdom,” one student described Kenneth Oye. Another lauded that “We are beyond lucky to have such a caring, supportive, empathetic and compassionate leader” in Maria Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Professors Maria Yang and Kenneth Oye are two of the 2023-25 Committed to Caring cohort, acknowledged for encouraging their students; advocating for meaningful, interesting research; and participating in their research journey from the beginning to end. For MIT graduate students, the Committed to Caring program recognizes those who go above and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Yang: Inclusion and continual fostering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Professor Maria Yang is the deputy dean of engineering, Kendall Rohsenow Professor, and professor of mechanical engineering. She works in the area of design theory, with a focus on the early stages of the process of design. Her current research interests include the hybrid ways in which humans and AI can collaborate during the design process and also ways in which we can design products to encourage users to behave more sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yang has been selected as a recipient of the Committed to Caring award for 2023-25. She is known for her inclusive, interdisciplinary work as well as her continuous fostering of students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yang founded and leads the Ideation Laboratory at MIT, which is characterized by interdisciplinary work in design, including product design, engineering design, and system design. Students may not feel like they “fit” in their traditional department, but find a home in the Ideation Laboratory. In Yang’s words, her students “collaborate and connect from their shared experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yang is one of the mentors of a student-led research project that works toward understanding how users, and other stakeholders who are traditionally not considered, are embedded in design education and practice, and how to support deeper engagement with such users and stakeholders. Yang supported her students on this project in multiple ways, providing mentorship and feedback as well as supporting her students to apply for grants to continue growing the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The students and Yang held a first-ever summit as a part of this project. The summit brought together faculty and students from MIT as well as other universities and companies. All the summit stakeholders are working to support instructors in thoughtfully considering users and stakeholders in their courses, and are striving to create a community for students and instructors engaged in this space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Maria will never take credit for the outcomes of the project, giving all the credit to other members of the project team,” the nominator wrote, “but she has been instrumental in supporting us and encouraging us to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yang continued to be a supportive and caring mentor, championing and supporting students’ work. When one nominator was still a prospective student, Yang met with them in support of their application. When the student was eventually admitted into the Media Lab rather than mechanical engineering, Yang welcomed the student into her research group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As the student’s career evolved, Yang became a member of their thesis committee and provided letters of recommendation for their academic job search. The nominator turned to Maria for advice on how to strategize what applications they would submit and which departments were the best fit for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yang took time to sit with the student, practiced their presentation with them, and gave support where the student was lacking confidence. All in all, Yang helped them have the strength to continue to achieve their goals, ultimately enabling them to earn their PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The nominator was grateful for the crucial role Maria played in fostering their growth: “My MIT experience would have been very different without Maria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Oye: Inspiring advisor and caring mentor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Oye is a professor of political science and data systems and society as well as the director of the Program on Emerging Technologies (PoET). His work revolves around international relations, political economy, and technology policy. His current work in technology policy centers on adaptive management of risks associated with synthetic biology and pharmaceuticals and on equity in health policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Oye has been selected as a recipient of the Committed to Caring award for 2023-25. He is a highly effective instructor, influential advisor, and considerate mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Oye teaches with clear and easy-to-follow language filled with personal stories and rich experiences. His lectures are interactive and engaging so that learners can truly internalize the material. His students gain understanding with curiosity and intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A nominator wrote that Oye encourages his students to investigate broadly. Oye offers&amp;nbsp;frequent advice on improvements in research design and shared analysis techniques. “He acknowledged my effort and ideas,” the nominator shared, “but also always encouraged me to explore further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The student added that parts of their dissertation were challenging, but Oye transformed it into an enjoyable intellectual quest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Oye emphasized that he cares about the work that is produced; however, he equally attends to his students as individuals. He consistently starts weekly meetings with check-ins and concerns himself with each of his student’s well-being and personal development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Students feel comfortable coming to Oye when they need to share their strife and seek counsel. Their mentoring relationship had built such trust, one nominator remarked, that when the student faced some personal challenges, “Ken was the first person I thought of that I could share my struggles with safely and ask for advice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As an instructor, an advisor, and as a mentor, Oye has helped his students learn and grow beyond the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of his students wrote, “Oye’s truly a gem to learn from and work with, and I believe he has been a great asset to MIT’s generations of students.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Bridging philosophy and AI to explore computing ethics</title>

  <description><![CDATA[In a new MIT course co-taught by EECS and philosophy professors, students tackle moral dilemmas of the digital age.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Danna Lorch | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During a meeting of class 6.C40/24.C40 (Ethics of Computing), Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/"&gt;Armando Solar-Lezama&lt;/a&gt; poses the same impossible question to his students that he often asks himself in the research he leads with the Computer Assisted Programming Group at MIT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"How do we make sure that a machine does what we want, and only what we want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At this moment, what some consider the golden age of generative AI, this may seem like an urgent new question. But Solar-Lezama, the Distinguished Professor of Computing at MIT, is quick to point out that this struggle is as old as humankind itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He begins to retell the Greek myth of King Midas, the monarch who was granted the godlike power to transform anything he touched into solid gold. Predictably, the wish backfired when Midas accidentally turned everyone he loved into gilded stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Be careful what you ask for because it might be granted in ways you don't expect," he says, cautioning his students, many of them aspiring mathematicians and programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Digging into MIT archives to share slides of grainy black-and-white photographs, he narrates the history of programming. We hear about the 1970s Pygmalion machine that required incredibly detailed cues, to the late '90s computer software that took teams of engineers years and an 800-page document to program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While remarkable in their time, these processes took too long to reach users. They left no room for spontaneous discovery, play, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Solar-Lezama talks about the risks of building modern machines that don't always respect a programmer's cues or red lines, and that are equally capable of exacting harm as saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Titus Roesler, a senior majoring in electrical engineering, nods knowingly. Roesler is writing his final paper on the ethics of autonomous vehicles and weighing who is morally responsible when one hypothetically hits and kills a pedestrian. His argument questions underlying assumptions behind technical advances, and considers multiple valid viewpoints. It leans on the philosophy theory of utilitarianism. Roesler explains, "Roughly, according to utilitarianism, the moral thing to do brings about the most good for the greatest number of people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT philosopher&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/bskow/www/"&gt;Brad Skow&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Solar-Lezama developed and is team-teaching the course, leans forward and takes notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A class that demands technical and philosophical expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ethics of Computing, offered for the first time in Fall 2024, was created through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/common-ground-for-computing-education/"&gt;Common Ground for Computing Education&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing that brings multiple departments together to develop and teach new courses and launch new programs that blend computing with other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The instructors alternate lecture days. Skow, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy, brings his discipline's lens for examining the broader implications of today's ethical issues, while Solar-Lezama, who is also the associate director and chief operating officer of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, offers perspective through his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Skow and Solar-Lezama attend one another's lectures and adjust their follow-up class sessions in response. Introducing the element of learning from one another in real time has made for more dynamic and responsive class conversations. A recitation to break down the week's topic with graduate students from philosophy or computer science and a lively discussion combine the course content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"An outsider might think that this is going to be a class that will make sure that these new computer programmers being sent into the world by MIT always do the right thing," Skow says. However, the class is intentionally designed to teach students a different skill set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Determined to create an impactful semester-long course that did more than lecture students about right or wrong, philosophy professor Caspar Hare conceived the idea for Ethics of Computing in his role as an associate dean of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt;. Hare recruited Skow and Solar-Lezama as the lead instructors, as he knew they could do something more profound than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Thinking deeply about the questions that come up in this class requires both technical and philosophical expertise. There aren't other classes at MIT that place both side-by-side,” Skow says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That's exactly what drew senior Alek Westover to enroll. The math and computer science double major explains, "A lot of people are talking about how the trajectory of AI will look in five years. I thought it was important to take a class that will help me think more about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Westover says he's drawn to philosophy because of an interest in ethics and a desire to distinguish right from wrong. In math classes, he's learned to write down a problem statement and receive instant clarity on whether he's successfully solved it or not. However, in Ethics of Computing, he has learned how to make written arguments for "tricky philosophical questions" that may not have a single correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For example, "One problem we could be concerned about is, what happens if we build powerful AI agents that can do any job a human can do?" Westover asks. "If we are interacting with these AIs to that degree, should we be paying them a salary? How much should we care about what they want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There's no easy answer, and Westover assumes he'll encounter many other dilemmas in the workplace in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“So, is the internet destroying the world?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The semester began with a deep dive into AI risk, or the notion of "whether AI poses an existential risk to humanity," unpacking free will, the science of how our brains make decisions under uncertainty, and debates about the long-term liabilities, and regulation of AI. A second, longer unit zeroed in on "the internet, the World Wide Web, and the social impact of technical decisions." The end of the term looks at privacy, bias, and free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One class topic was devoted to provocatively asking: "So, is the internet destroying the world?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senior Caitlin Ogoe is majoring in Course 6-9 (Computation and Cognition). Being in an environment where she can examine these types of issues is precisely why the self-described "technology skeptic" enrolled in the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Growing up with a mom who is hearing impaired and a little sister with a developmental disability, Ogoe became the default family member whose role it was to call providers for tech support or program iPhones. She leveraged her skills into a part-time job fixing cell phones, which paved the way for her to develop a deep interest in computation, and a path to MIT. However, a prestigious summer fellowship in her first year made her question the ethics behind how consumers were impacted by the technology she was helping to program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Everything I've done with technology is from the perspective of people, education, and personal connection," Ogoe says. "This is a niche that I love. Taking humanities classes around public policy, technology, and culture is one of my big passions, but this is the first course I've taken that also involves a philosophy professor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The following week, Skow lectures on the role of bias in AI, and Ogoe, who is entering the workforce next year, but plans to eventually attend law school to focus on regulating related issues, raises her hand to ask questions or share counterpoints four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Skow digs into examining COMPAS, a controversial AI software that uses an algorithm to predict the likelihood that people accused of crimes would go on to re-offend. According to a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm"&gt;2018 ProPublica article&lt;/a&gt;, COMPAS was likely to flag Black defendants as future criminals and gave false positives at twice the rate as it did to white defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The class session is dedicated to determining whether the article warrants the conclusion that the COMPAS system is biased and should be discontinued. To do so, Skow introduces two different theories on fairness:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Substantive fairness is the idea that a particular outcome might be fair or unfair," he explains. "Procedural fairness is about whether the procedure by which an outcome is produced is fair." A variety of conflicting criteria of fairness are then introduced, and the class discusses which were plausible, and what conclusions they warranted about the COMPAS system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Later on, the two professors go upstairs to Solar-Lezama's office to debrief on how the exercise had gone that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Who knows?" says Solar-Lezama. "Maybe five years from now, everybody will laugh at how people were worried about the existential risk of AI. But one of the themes I see running through this class is learning to approach these debates beyond media discourse and getting to the bottom of thinking rigorously about these issues."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In India, many kids who work in retail markets have good math skills: They can quickly perform a range of calculations to complete transactions. But as a new study shows, these kids often perform much worse on the same kinds of problems as they are taught in the classroom. This happens even though many of these students still attend school or attended school through 7th or 8th grades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the study also finds, Indian students who are still enrolled in school and don’t have jobs do better on school-type math problems, but they often fare poorly at the kinds of problems that occur in marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, both the “market kids” and the “school kids” struggle with the approach the other group is proficient in, raising questions about how to help both groups learn math more comprehensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the school kids, they do worse when you go from an abstract problem to a concrete problem,” says MIT economist Esther Duflo, co-author of a new paper detailing the study’s results. “For the market kids, it’s the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the kids with jobs who are also in school “underperform despite being extraordinarily good at mental math,” says Abhijit Banerjee an MIT economist and another co-author of the paper. “That for me was always the revelation, that the one doesn’t translate into the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w" target="_blank"&gt;Children’s arithmetic skills do not transfer between applied and academic math&lt;/a&gt;,” is published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The authors are&amp;nbsp;Banerjee, the Ford Professor of Economics at MIT; Swati Bhattacharjee of the newspaper &lt;em&gt;Ananda Bazar Patrika,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;in Kolkata, India; Raghabendra Chattopadhyay of the Indian Institute of Management in Kolkata; Duflo, the Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Poverty Alleviation and Development Economics at MIT;&amp;nbsp;Alejandro J. Ganimian, a professor of applied psychology and economics at New York University; Kailash Rajaha, a doctoral candidate in economics at MIT; and Elizabeth S. Spelke, a professor of psychology at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duflo and Banerjee &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/esther-duflo-abhijit-banerjee-win-2019-nobel-prize-economics-1014" target="_blank"&gt;shared the Nobel Prize in Economics&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and are co-founders of MIT’s Jameel Abdul Latif Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), a global leader in development economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three experiments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study consists largely of three data-collection exercises with some embedded experiments. The first one shows that 201 kids working in markets in Kolkata do have good math skills. For instance, a researcher, posing as an ordinary shopper, would ask for the cost of 800 grams of potatoes sold at 20 rupees per kilogram, then ask for the cost of 1.4 kilograms of onions sold at 15 rupees per kilo. They would request the combined answer — 37 rupees —&amp;nbsp; then hand the market worker a 200 rupee note and collect 163 rupees back. All told, the kids working in markets correctly solved this kind of problem from 95 to 98 percent of the time by the second try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the working children were pulled aside (with their parents’ permission) and given a standardized Indian national math test, just 32 percent could correctly divide a three-digit number by a one-digit number, and just 54 percent could correctly subtract a two-digit number from another two-digit number two times. Clearly, the kids’ skills were not yielding classroom results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then conducted a second study with 400 kids working in markets in Delhi, which replicated the results: Working kids had a strong ability to handle market transactions, but only about 15 percent of the ones also in school were at average proficiency in math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second study, the researchers also asked the reverse question: How do students doing well in school fare at market math problems? Here, with 200 students from 17 Delhi schools who do not work in markets, they found that 96 percent of the students could solve typical problems with a pencil, paper, unlimited time, and one opportunity to self-correct. But when the students had to solve the problems in a make-believe “market” setting, that figure dropped to just 60 percent.&amp;nbsp;The students had unlimited time and access to paper and pencil, so that figure may actually overestimate how they would fare in a market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in a third study, conducted in Delhi with over 200 kids, the researchers compared the performances of both “market” and “school” kids again on numerous math problems in varying conditions. While 85 percent of the working kids got the right answer to a market transaction problem, only 10 percent of nonworking kids correctly answered a&amp;nbsp;question of similar difficulty, when faced with limited time and with no aids like pencil and paper.&amp;nbsp;However, given the same division and subtraction problems, but with pencil and paper, 59 percent of nonmarket kids got them right, compared to 45 percent of market kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further evaluate market kids and school kids on a level playing field, the researchers then presented each group with a word problem about a boy going to the market and buying two vegetables. Roughly one-third of the market kids were able to solve this without any aid, while fewer than 1 percent of the school kids did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why might the performance of the nonworking students decline when given a problem in market conditions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They learned an algorithm but didn’t understand it,” Banerjee says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the market kids seemed to use certain tactics to handle retail transactions. For one thing, they appear to use rounding well. Take a problem like 43 times 11. To handle that intuitively, you might multiply 43 times 10, and then add 43, for the final answer of 473. This appears to be what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The market kids are able to exploit base 10, so they do better on base 10 problems,” Duflo says. “The school kids have no idea. It makes no difference to them.&amp;nbsp;The market kids may have additional tricks of this sort that we did not see.” On the other hand, the school kids had a better grasp of formal written methods of division, subtraction, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going farther in school&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings raise a significant point about students skills and academic progress. While it is a good thing that the kids with market jobs are proficient at generating rapid answers, it would likely be better for the long-term futures if they also did well in school and wound up with a high school degree or better. Finding a way to cross the divide between informal and formal ways of tackling math problems, then, could notably help some Indian children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that such a divide exists, meanwhile, suggests some new approaches could be tried in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banerjee, for one, suspects that part of the issue is a classroom process making it seem as if there is only one true route to funding an arithmetic answer. Instead, he believes, following the work of co-author Spelke, that helping students reason their way to an approximation of the right answer can help them truly get a handle on what is needed to solve these types of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Duflo adds, “We don’t want to blame the teachers. It’s not their fault. They are given a strict curriculum to follow, and strict methods to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That still leaves open the question of what to change, in concrete classroom terms. That topic, it happens, is something the research group is in the process of weighing, as they consider new experiments that might address it directly. The current finding, however, makes clear progress would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal mathematics,” the authors state in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for the research was provided, in part, by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab’s Post-Primary Education Initiative, the Foundation Blaise Pascal, and the AXA Research Fund.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senior Audrey Lorvo is researching AI safety, which seeks to ensure increasingly intelligent AI models are reliable and can benefit humanity.&amp;nbsp;The growing field focuses on technical challenges like robustness and AI alignment with human values, as well as societal concerns like transparency and accountability. Practitioners are also concerned with the potential existential risks associated with increasingly powerful AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Ensuring AI isn’t misused or acts contrary to our intentions is increasingly important as we approach artificial general intelligence (AGI),” says Lorvo, a &lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-14-computer-science-economics-and-data-science/" target="_blank"&gt;computer science, economics, and data science&lt;/a&gt; major. AGI describes the potential of artificial intelligence to match or surpass human cognitive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;An MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/serc-scholars-program/"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC) scholar&lt;/a&gt;, Lorvo looks closely at how AI might automate AI research and development processes and practices. A member of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/serc-projects/"&gt;Big Data research group&lt;/a&gt;, she’s investigating the social and economic implications associated with AI’s potential to accelerate research on itself and how to effectively communicate these ideas and potential impacts to general audiences including legislators, strategic advisors, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lorvo emphasizes the need to critically assess AI’s rapid advancements and their implications, ensuring organizations have proper frameworks and strategies in place to address risks. “We need to both ensure humans reap AI’s benefits and that we don’t lose control of the technology,” she says. “We need to do all we can to develop it safely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Her participation in efforts like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://haist.ai/tech-fellowship"&gt;AI Safety Technical Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; reflect her investment in understanding the technical aspects of AI safety. The fellowship provides opportunities to review existing research on aligning AI development with considerations of potential human impact. “The fellowship helped me understand AI safety’s technical questions and challenges so I can potentially propose better AI governance strategies,” she says. According to Lorvo, companies on AI’s frontier continue to push boundaries, which means we’ll need to implement effective policies that prioritize human safety without impeding research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value from human engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When arriving at MIT, Lorvo knew she wanted to pursue a course of study that would allow her to work at the intersection of science and the humanities. The variety of offerings at the Institute made her choices difficult, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are so many ways to help advance the quality of life for individuals and communities,” she says, “and MIT offers so many different paths for investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beginning with economics — a discipline she enjoys because of its focus on quantifying impact — Lorvo investigated math, political science, and urban planning before choosing Course 6-14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/josh-angrist"&gt;Joshua Angrist’s&lt;/a&gt; econometrics classes helped me see the value in focusing on economics, while the data science and computer science elements appealed to me because of the growing reach and potential impact of AI,” she says. “We can use these tools to tackle some of the world’s most pressing problems and hopefully overcome serious challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lorvo has also pursued concentrations in &lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;urban studies and planning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/international-development" target="_blank"&gt;international development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As she’s narrowed her focus, Lorvo finds she shares an outlook on humanity with other members of the MIT community like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://aialignment.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT AI Alignment group&lt;/a&gt;, from whom she learned quite a bit about AI safety. “Students care about their marginal impact,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Marginal impact, the additional effect of a specific investment of time, money, or effort,&amp;nbsp;is a way to measure how much a contribution adds to what is already being done, rather than focusing on the total impact. This can potentially influence where people choose to devote their resources, an idea that appeals to Lorvo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In a world of limited resources, a data-driven approach to solving some of our biggest challenges can benefit from a tailored approach that directs people to where they’re likely to do the most good,” she says.&amp;nbsp;“If you want to maximize your social impact, reflecting on your career choice’s marginal impact can be very valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lorvo also values MIT’s focus on educating the whole student and has taken advantage of opportunities to investigate disciplines like philosophy through&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://concourse.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Concourse&lt;/a&gt;, a program that facilitates dialogue between science and the humanities. Concourse hopes participants gain guidance, clarity, and purpose for scientific, technical, and human pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student experiences at the Institute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lorvo invests her time outside the classroom in creating memorable experiences and fostering relationships with her classmates. “I’m fortunate that there’s space to balance my coursework, research, and club commitments with other activities, like weightlifting and off-campus initiatives,” she says. “There are always so many clubs and events available across the Institute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These opportunities to expand her worldview have challenged her beliefs and exposed her to new interest areas that have altered her life and career choices for the better. Lorvo, who is fluent in French, English, Spanish, and Portuguese, also applauds MIT for the international experiences it provides for students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I’ve interned in Santiago de Chile and Paris with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/"&gt;MISTI&lt;/a&gt; and helped&amp;nbsp;test a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/news-blog/blog/we-move-it-move-it-madagascar-testing-water-vapor-condensing-chamber"&gt;water vapor condensing chamber&lt;/a&gt; that we designed in a fall 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/"&gt;D-Lab&lt;/a&gt; class in collaboration with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.univ-antananarivo.mg/Ecole-Normale-Superieure-d-Antananarivo"&gt;Madagascar Polytechnic School&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://tatirano.org/"&gt;Tatirano NGO&lt;/a&gt; [nongovernmental organization],” she says, “and have enjoyed the opportunities to learn about addressing economic inequality through my International Development and D-Lab classes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As president of MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mit-uea.github.io/"&gt;Undergraduate Economics Association&lt;/a&gt;, Lorvo connects with other students interested in economics while continuing to expand her understanding of the field. She enjoys the relationships she’s building while also participating in the association’s events throughout the year. “Even as a senior, I’ve found new campus communities to explore and appreciate,” she says. “I encourage other students to continue exploring groups and classes that spark their interests throughout their time at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After graduation, Lorvo wants to continue investigating AI safety and researching governance strategies that can help ensure AI’s safe and effective deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Good governance is essential to AI’s successful development and ensuring humanity can benefit from its transformative potential,” she says. “We must continue to monitor AI’s growth and capabilities as the technology continues to evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Understanding technology’s potential impacts on humanity, doing good, continually improving, and creating spaces where big ideas can see the light of day continue to drive Lorvo. Merging the humanities with the sciences animates much of what she does. “I always hoped to contribute to improving people’s lives, and AI represents humanity’s greatest challenge and opportunity yet,” she says. “I believe the AI safety field can benefit from people with interdisciplinary experiences like the kind I’ve been fortunate to gain, and I encourage anyone passionate about shaping the future to explore it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Faith Brooks, a graduate student in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mit.whoi.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT-WHOI Joint Program&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;has had a clear dream since the age of 4: to become a pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At around 8 years old, my neighbor knew I wanted to fly and showed me pictures of her dad landing a jet on an aircraft carrier, and I was immediately captivated,” says Brooks. Further inspired by her grandfather’s experience in the U.S. Navy (USN), and owing to a lifelong fascination with aviation, she knew nothing would stand in her way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks explored several different paths to becoming a pilot, but she says one conversation with her longtime mentor, Capt. Matt Skone, USN (Ret.), changed the trajectory of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He asked if I had heard of the Naval Academy,” she recalls. “At the time, I hadn’t … I immediately knew that that was where I wanted to go, and everything else I learned about United States Naval Academy (USNA) reinforced that for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her “firstie” (senior) year at the USNA, Brooks was selected to go to Pensacola, Florida, and train to become a naval pilot as a student naval aviator, taking her one step closer to her dream. The USNA also helped guide her path to MIT. Her journey to joining the MIT-WHOI Joint Program began with the USNA’s professional knowledge curriculum, where she read about retired Capt. Wendy Lawrence SM ’88, a naval aviator and astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reading her bio prompted me to&amp;nbsp;look into&amp;nbsp;the program, and it sounded like the perfect program for me — where else could you get a better education in ocean engineering than MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution [WHOI]?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, Brooks is researching the impact of coastal pond breaching on preventing and mitigating harmful algal blooms. Her work focuses on the biannual mechanical breaching of Nantucket’s Sesachacha Pond to the ocean and the resultant impact on the pond’s water quality. This practice aims to improve water quality and mitigate harmful algal blooms (HABs), especially in summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaching in coastal ponds is a process that was initially used to enhance salinity for herring and shellfish habitats, but has since shifted to address water quality concerns. Traditionally, an excavator creates a breach in the pond, which naturally closes within one to five days, influenced by sediment transport and weather conditions. High winds and waves can accelerate sediment movement, limiting ocean water exchange and potentially increasing eutrophication, where excessive nutrients lead to dense plant growth and depletion of oxygen. In brackish water environments, harmful algal blooms are often driven by elevated nitrogen levels and higher temperatures, with higher nitrogen concentrating leading to more frequent and severe blooms as temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nantucket Natural Resources Department (NRD) has been collaborating with local homeowners to investigate the pond breaching process. Existing data are mainly anecdotal evidence and NRD’s monthly sampling since 2022, which has not shown the expected decrease in eutrophication. Brooks’ research will focus on data before, during, and after the breach at two pond sites to assess water changes to evaluate its effectiveness in improving water quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Brooks isn’t knee-deep in the waters of the Sesachacha or training with her MIT Triathlon team, she takes additional opportunities to further her education. Last year, Brooks participated in the MIT-Portugal Marine Robotics Summer School in Faial, Azores, in Portugal, and immersed herself in a combination of a hands-on design projects and lectures on a variety of topics related to oceanography, engineering, and marine robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My favorite part of the program was how interdisciplinary it was. We had a combination of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, computer scientists, marine biologists, and oceanographers, and we had teams that included each of these specialties,” she says. “Our project involved designing a lander equipped with an underwater camera connected to a surface buoy that would transmit the footage. Having worked in mostly just engineering teams previously, it was a great experience to work with a more diverse group and I gained a much better understanding of how to design instruments and systems in accordance with what the marine biologists need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks also earned her Part 107 Small Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) license to operate the lab’s drone with a multispectral camera for her upcoming fieldwork. When she graduates from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program next September, she’ll report to the Naval Aviation Schools Command in Pensacola, Florida, to begin flight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she says she’ll miss Boston’s charm and history, as well as the Shining Sea Bikeway on crisp fall days in Woods Hole, Brooks is looking forward to putting her uniform back on, and starting her naval career and flight school. The time Brooks has spent at MIT will support her in these future endeavors. She advises others interested in a similar path to focus on research within their areas of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest lesson that I’ve learned from both research theses is that any research project will change over time, and it’s often a good idea to take a step back and look at how your work fits into the larger picture,” she says. “I couldn’t recommend doing research more; it’s such a great opportunity to dig into something that you’re interested in, and is also very fulfilling.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the world of high-priced art, galleries usually act as gatekeepers. Their selective curation process is a key reason galleries in major cities often feature work from the same batch of artists. The system limits opportunities for emerging artists and leaves great art undiscovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NALA was founded by Benjamin Gulak ’22 to disrupt the gallery model. The company’s digital platform, which was started as part of an MIT class project, allows artists to list their art and uses machine learning and data science to offer personalized recommendations to art lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By providing a much larger pool of artwork to buyers, the company is dismantling the exclusive barriers put up by traditional galleries and efficiently connecting creators with collectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much talent out there that has never had the opportunity to be seen outside of the artists’ local market,” Gulak says. “We’re opening the art world to all artists, creating a true meritocracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NALA takes no commission from artists, instead charging buyers an 11.5 percent commission on top of the artist’s listed price. Today more than 20,000 art lovers are using NALA's platform, and the company has registered more than 8,500 artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My goal is for NALA to become the dominant place where art is discovered, bought, and sold online,” Gulak says. “The gallery model has existed for such a long period of time that they are the tastemakers in the art world. However, most buyers never realize how restrictive the industry has been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From founder to student to founder again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Canada, Gulak worked hard to get into MIT, participating in science fairs and robotic competitions throughout high school. When he was 16, he created an electric, one-wheeled motorcycle that got him on the popular television show “Shark Tank” and was later named one of the top inventions of the year by &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulak was accepted into MIT in 2009 but withdrew from his undergrad program shortly after entering to launch a business around the media exposure and capital from “Shark Tank.” Following a whirlwind decade in which he raised more than $12 million and sold thousands of units globally, Gulak decided to return to MIT to complete his degree, switching his major from mechanical engineering to one combining &lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-14-computer-science-economics-and-data-science/" target="_blank"&gt;computer science, economics, and data science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I spent 10 years of my life building my business, and realized to get the company where I wanted it to be, it would take another decade, and that wasn’t what I wanted to be doing,” Gulak says. “I missed learning, and I missed the academic side of my life. I basically begged MIT to take me back, and it was the best decision I ever made.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the ups and downs of running his company, Gulak took up painting to de-stress. Art had always been a part of Gulak’s life, and he had even done a fine arts study abroad program in Italy during high school. Determined to try selling his art, he collaborated with some prominent art galleries in London, Miami, and St. Moritz. Eventually he began connecting artists he’d met on travels from emerging markets like Cuba, Egypt, and Brazil to the gallery owners he knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results were incredible because these artists were used to selling their work to tourists for $50, and suddenly they’re hanging work in a fancy gallery in London and getting 5,000 pounds,” Gulak says. “It was the same artist, same talent, but different buyers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Gulak was in his third year at MIT and wondering what he’d do after graduation. He thought he wanted to start a new business, but every industry he looked at was dominated by tech giants. Every industry, that is, except the art world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The art industry is archaic,” Gulak says. “Galleries have monopolies over small groups of artists, and they have absolute control over the prices. The buyers are told what the value is, and almost everywhere you look in the industry, there’s inefficiencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Gulak was studying the recommender engines that are used to populate social media feeds and personalize show and music suggestions, and he envisioned something similar for the visual arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought, why, when I go on the big art platforms, do I see horrible combinations of artwork even though I’ve had accounts on these platforms for years?” Gulak says. “I’d get new emails every week titled ‘New art for your collection,’ and the platform had no idea about my taste or budget.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a class project at MIT, Gulak built a system that tried to predict the types of art that would do well in a gallery. By his final year at MIT, he had realized that working directly with artists would be a more promising approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Online platforms typically take a 30 percent fee, and galleries can take an additional 50 percent fee, so the artist ends up with a small percentage of each online sale, but the buyer also has to pay a luxury import duty on the full price,” Gulak explains. “That means there’s a massive amount of fat in the middle, and that’s where our direct-to-artist business model comes in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today NALA, which stands for Networked Artistic Learning Algorithm, onboards artists by having them upload artwork and fill out a questionnaire about their style. They can begin uploading work immediately and choose their listing price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company began by using AI to match art with its most likely buyer. Gulak notes that not all art will sell — “if you’re making rock paintings there may not be a big market” — and artists may price their work higher than buyers are willing to pay, but the algorithm works to put art in front of the most likely buyer based on style preferences and budget. NALA also handles sales and shipments, providing artists with 100 percent of their list price from every sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By not taking commissions, we’re very pro artists,” Gulak says. “We also allow all artists to participate, which is unique in this space. NALA is built by artists for artists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, NALA also started allowing buyers to take a photo of something they like and see similar artwork from its database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In museums, people will take a photo of masterpieces they’ll never be able to afford, and now they can find living artists producing the same style that they could actually put in their home,” Gulak says. “It makes art more accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Championing artists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Ben Gulak was visiting Egypt when he discovered an impressive mural on the street. Gulak found the local artist, Ahmed Nofal, on Instagram and bought some work. Later,&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;he brought Nofal to Dubai to participate in World Art Dubai. The artist’s work was so well-received he ended up creating murals for the Royal British Museum in London and Red Bull. Most recently, Nofal and Gulak collaborated together during Art Basel 2024 doing a mural at the Museum of Graffiti in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulak has worked personally with many of the artists on his platform. For more than a decade he’s travelled to Cuba buying art and delivering art supplies to friends. He’s also worked with artists as they work to secure immigration visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people claim they want to help the art world, but in reality, they often fall back on the same outdated business models,” says Gulak. “Art isn’t just my passion — it’s a way of life for me. I’ve been on every side of the art world: as a painter selling my work through galleries, as a collector with my office brimming with art, and as a collaborator working alongside incredible talents like Raheem Saladeen Johnson. When artists visit, we create together, sharing ideas and brainstorming. These experiences, combined with my background as both an artist and a computer scientist, give me a unique perspective. I’m trying to use technology to provide artists with unparalleled access to the global market and shake things up.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" paraid="47805235" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{88}"&gt;Shreya Mogulothu is naturally curious. As a high school student in New Jersey, she was interested in mathematics and theoretical computer science (TCS). So, when her curiosity compelled her to learn more, she turned to MIT Open Learning’s online resources and completed the &lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+24.118x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paradox and Infinity&lt;/a&gt; course on &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; Online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="229597260" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{113}"&gt;“Coming from a math and TCS background, the idea of pushing against the limits of assumptions was really interesting,” says Mogulothu, now a junior at MIT. “I mean, who wouldn’t want to learn more about infinity?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="284799756" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{127}"&gt;The class, taught by Agustín Rayo, professor of philosophy and the current dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, and David Balcarras, a former instructor in philosophy and fellow in the Digital Learning Lab at Open Learning, explores the intersection of math and philosophy and guides learners through thinking about paradoxes and open-ended problems, as well as the boundaries of theorizing and the limits of standard mathematical tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="660947054" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{143}"&gt;“We talked about taking regular assumptions about numbers and objects and pushing them to extremes,” Mogulothu says. “For example, what contradictions arise when you talk about an infinite set of things, like the infinite hats paradox?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1235235767" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{153}"&gt;The infinite hats paradox, also known as Bacon’s Puzzle, involves an infinite line of people, each wearing one of two colors of hats. The puzzle posits that each individual can see only the hat of the person in front of them and must guess the color of their own hat. The puzzle challenges students to identify if there is a strategy that can ensure the least number of incorrect answers and to consider how strategy may change if there is a finite number of people. Mogulothu was thrilled that a class like this was available to her even though she wasn’t yet affiliated with MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1652197076" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{233}"&gt;“My &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; experience was one of the reasons I came to MIT,” she says. “I really liked the course, and I was happy it was shared with people like me, who didn’t even go to the school. I thought that a place that encouraged even people outside of campus to learn like that would be a pretty good place to study.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="2041449983" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{18}"&gt;Looking back at the course, Balcarras says, “Shreya may have been the most impressive student in our online community of approximately 3,900 learners and 100 verified learners. I cannot single out another student whose performance rivaled hers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="2048737798" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{40}"&gt;Because of her excellent performance, Mogulothu was invited to submit her work to the &lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sts-042-einstein-oppenheimer-feynman-physics-in-the-20th-century-fall-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2021 &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; Philosophy Awards.&lt;/a&gt; She won. In fact, Balcarras remembers, both papers she wrote for the course would have won. They demonstrated, he says, “an unusually high degree of precision, formal acumen, and philosophical subtlety for a high school student.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="281279263" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{73}"&gt;Completing the course and winning the award was rewarding, Mogulothu says. It motivated her to keep exploring new things as a high school student, and then as a new student enrolled at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="362508324" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{89}"&gt;She came to college thinking she would declare a major in math or computer science. But when she looked at the courses she was most interested in, she realized she should pursue a physics major.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1132034822" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{115}"&gt;She has enjoyed the courses in her major, especially class STS.042J/8.225J (Einstein, Oppenheimer, Feynman: Physics in the 20th Century), taught by David Kaiser, the Germeshausen Professor of the History of Science and professor of physics. She took the course on campus, but it is also available on Open Learning’s &lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sts-042-einstein-oppenheimer-feynman-physics-in-the-20th-century-fall-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MIT OpenCourseWare.&lt;/a&gt; As a student, she continues to use MIT Open Learning resources to check out courses and review syllabi as she plans her coursework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1985279570" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{154}"&gt;In summer 2024, Mogulothu did research on gravitational wave detection at PIER, the partnership between research center DESY and the University of Hamburg, in Hamburg, Germany. She wants to pursue a PhD in physics to keep researching, expanding her mind, and indulging the curiosity that led her to &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; in the first place. She encourages all learners to feel comfortable and confident trying something entirely new.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1253127952" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{188}"&gt;“I went into the Paradox and Infinity course thinking, ‘yeah, math is cool, computer science is cool,’” she says. “But, actually taking the course and learning about things you don’t even expect to exist is really powerful. It increases your curiosity and is super rewarding to stick with something and realize how much you can learn and grow.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT philosopher Sally Haslanger&amp;nbsp;has been named the 2024 recipient of the prestigious&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.apaonline.org/page/quinn?&amp;amp;hhsearchterms=%22quinn+and+prize%22"&gt;Philip L. Quinn Prize&lt;/a&gt; from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.apaonline.org/"&gt;American Philosophical Association&lt;/a&gt; (APA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The award recognizes Haslanger’s lifelong contributions to philosophy and philosophers.&amp;nbsp;Haslanger, the&amp;nbsp;Ford Professor of Philosophy and Women’s and Gender Studies, says she is deeply honored by the recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“So many philosophers I deeply respect have come before me as awardees, including Judith Jarvis Thomson, my former colleague and lifelong inspiration,” Haslanger says. “Judy and I both were deeply engaged in doing metaphysics with an eye toward the moral/political domain. Both of us were committed feminists in a time when it was not professionally easy. Both of us believed in the power of institutions, such as the APA and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.aaup.org/"&gt;American Association of University Professors&lt;/a&gt; (AAUP), to sustain a flourishing intellectual community. Both of us have&amp;nbsp;demanded that institutions we are part of&amp;nbsp;abide by their values.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Haslanger joined the MIT faculty in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Her research features explorations of the social construction of categories like gender, race, and the family; social explanation and social structure; and topics in feminist epistemology. She has also published in metaphysics and critical race theory. Broadly speaking, her work links issues of social justice with contemporary work in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Her book,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/resisting-reality-9780199892624?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;"&gt;Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique&lt;/a&gt;” (Oxford University Press, 2012), was awarded the Joseph B. Gittler prize for outstanding work in the philosophy of social science.&amp;nbsp;She also co-authored&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/what-is-race-9780190610180?q=What%20is%20Race:%20Four%20Philosophical%20Views&amp;amp;cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;What is Race: Four Philosophical Views&lt;/a&gt;” (Oxford University Press, 2019). Her current book,&amp;nbsp;“Doing Justice to the Social” (under contract with Oxford University Press), develops an account of social practices and structures, emphasizing their materiality, the role of ideology, and potential grounds for critique.

Bridging a deep divide, she has brought critical social theory into conversation with analytic philosophy, arguing for an account of social structures and practices that does justice to their materiality,” Setiya says. “This work earned her a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.gf.org/"&gt;Guggenheim Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; as well as membership in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.amacad.org/"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, along with invitations to give lectures named after canonical philosophers past and present: Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Hempel, Kant, Spinoza, and others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Setiya noted Haslanger’s substantial contributions to the field, including her role in founding the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://piksiboston.weebly.com/"&gt;Philosophy in an Inclusive Key Summer Institute&lt;/a&gt; (PIKSI) in Boston, which for 10 years has brought diverse undergraduates to MIT to show them that&amp;nbsp;graduate study in philosophy is a meaningful option for them and to mentor them as they apply to graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“As Sally’s colleague, I am in awe not just of her extraordinary philosophical and professional achievements, but of her integrity and the seemingly limitless energy she invests in her students, in the Philosophy Section, in MIT, in the profession, and in fighting for social justice in the world from which academia is inextricable,” Setiya adds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Angelina Wu has been taking &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/areas-of-study/japanese-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; classes at MIT since arriving as a first-year student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I have had such a wonderful experience learning the language, getting to know my classmates, and interacting with the Japanese community at MIT,” says Wu, now a senior majoring in computer science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It’s been an integral part of my MIT experience, supplementing my other technical skills and also giving me opportunities to meet many people outside my major that I likely wouldn’t have had otherwise. As a result, I feel like I get to understand a much broader, more complete version of MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, Wu is sharing her experience and giving back as a &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/people-type/student-ambassadors/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Languages Student Ambassador&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;At a recent Global Languages preregistration fair, Wu spoke with other students interested in pursuing Japanese studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I could not be happier to help promote such an experience to curious students and the greater MIT community,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Global Language Student Ambassadors is a group of students who lead&amp;nbsp;outreach efforts to help increase visibility for the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to disseminating information and promotional materials to the MIT undergraduate community, student ambassadors are asked to organize and host informal gatherings for Global Languages students around themes related to language and cultural exploration to build community and provide opportunities for learning and fun outside of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Global Languages director Per Urlaub isn’t surprised that the Student Ambassadors program is popular with both students and the MIT community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The Global Languages program brings people together,” he says. “Providing a caring learning environment and creating a sense of belonging are central to our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What’s also central to the Global Languages’ mission is centering students’ work and creating spaces in which language learning can help create connections across academic areas. Students who study languages&amp;nbsp;may improve their understanding of the cultural facets that underlie communication across cultures and open new worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“An engaging community that fosters a deep sense of belonging doesn’t just happen automatically,” Urlaub notes.&amp;nbsp;“A stronger community elevates our students’ proficiency gains, and also makes language learning more meaningful and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Each student ambassador serves for a single academic year in their area of language focus. They work closely with MIT’s academic administrators to plan, communicate, and stage events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I love exploring the richness of the &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/areas-of-study/arabic-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; language, especially how it connects to my culture and heritage,” says Heba Hussein, a student ambassador studying Arabic and majoring in electrical science and engineering. “I believe that having a strong grasp of languages and cultural awareness will help me work effectively in diverse teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Student ambassadors, alongside other language learners, discover how other languages, cultures, and countries can guide their communications with others while shaping how they understand the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/areas-of-study/spanish-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; courses at MIT have been a highlight of my college experience thus far — the opportunity to connect on a deeper level with other cultures and force myself out of my comfort zone in conversations is important to me,” says Katie Kempff, another student ambassador who is majoring in climate system science and engineering and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“As a heritage speaker, learning &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/areas-of-study/chinese-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; has been a way for me to connect with my culture and my roots,” adds Zixuan Liu, a double major in biological engineering and biology, and a Chinese student ambassador, who says that as a heritage speaker, learning Chinese has been a way for her to connect with her culture and her roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I would highly recommend diving into languages and culture at MIT, where the support and the community really enhances the experience,” Liu says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2025/study-shows-how-households-can-cut-energy-costs-0113</guid>
        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many people around the globe are living in energy poverty, meaning they spend at least 8 percent of their annual household income on energy. Addressing this problem is not simple, but an experiment by MIT researchers shows that giving people better data about their energy use, plus some coaching on the subject, can lead them to substantially reduce their consumption and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment, based in Amsterdam, resulted in households cutting their energy expenses in half, on aggregate — a savings big enough to move three-quarters of them out of energy poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our energy coaching project as a whole showed a 75 percent success rate at alleviating energy poverty,” says Joseph Llewellyn, a researcher with MIT’s Senseable City Lab and co-author of a newly published paper detailing the experiment’s results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Energy poverty afflicts families all over the world. With empirical evidence on which policies work, governments could focus their efforts more effectively,” says Fábio Duarte, associate director of MIT’s Senseable City Lab, and another co-author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-80773-9" target="_blank"&gt;Assessing the impact of energy coaching with smart technology interventions to alleviate energy poverty&lt;/a&gt;,” appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are Llewellyn, who is also a researcher at the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS) and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm; Titus Venverloo, a research fellow at the MIT Senseable City Lab and AMS; Fábio Duarte, who is also a principal researcher MIT’s Senseable City Lab; Carlo Ratti, director of the Senseable City Lab; and Cecilia Katzeff, Fredrik Johansson, and Daniel Pargman&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed the study after engaging with city officials in Amsterdam. In the Netherlands, about 550,000 households, or 7 percent of the population, are considered to be in energy poverty; in the European Union, that figure is about 50 million. In the U.S., separate research has shown that about three in 10 households report trouble paying energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct the experiment, the researchers ran two versions of an energy coaching intervention. In one version, 67 households received one report on their energy usage, along with coaching about how to increase energy efficiency. In the other version, 50 households received those things as well as a smart device giving them real-time updates on their energy consumption. (All households also received some modest energy-savings improvements at the outset, such as additional insulation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the two groups, homes typically reduced monthly consumption of electricity by 33 percent and gas by 42 percent. They lowered their bills by 53 percent, on aggregate, and the percentage of income they spent on energy dropped from 10.1 percent to 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What were these households doing differently? Some of the biggest behavioral changes included things such as only heating rooms that were in use and unplugging devices not being used. Both of those changes save energy, but their benefits were not always understood by residents before they received energy coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The range of energy literacy was quite wide from one home to the next,” Llewellyn says. “And when I went somewhere as an energy coach, it was never to moralize about energy use. I never said, ‘Oh, you’re using way too much.’ It was always working on it with the households, depending on what people need for their homes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the homes receiving the small devices that displayed real-time energy data only tended to use them for three or four weeks following a coaching visit. After that, people seemed to lose interest in very frequent monitoring of their energy use. And yet, a few weeks of consulting the devices tended to be long enough to get people to change their habits in a lasting way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that smart devices need to be accompanied by a close understanding of what drives families to change their behaviors,” Venverloo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers acknowledge, working with consumers to reduce their energy consumption is just one way to help people escape energy poverty. Other “structural” factors that can help include lower energy prices and more energy-efficient buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the latter note, the current paper has given rise to a new experiment Llewellyn is developing with Amsterdam officials, to examine the benefits of retrofitting residental buildings to lower energy costs. In that case, local policymakers are trying to work out how to fund the retrofitting in such a way that landlords do not simply pass those costs on to tenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want a household to save money on their energy bills if it also means the rent increases, because then we’ve just displaced expenses from one item to another,” Llewellyn says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Households can also invest in products like better insulation themselves, for windows or heating components, although for low-income households, finding the money to pay for such things may not be trivial. That is especially the case, Llewellyn suggests, because energy costs can seem “invisible,” and a lower priority, than feeding and clothing a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big upfront cost for a household that does not have 100 Euros to spend,” Llewellyn says. Compared to paying for other necessities, he notes, “Energy is often the thing that tends to fall last on their list. Energy is always going to be this invisible thing that hides behind the walls, and it’s not easy to change that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Q&amp;A: Examining American attitudes on global climate policies</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Professor Evan Lieberman describes new research in which he and colleagues find a sharp partisan divide over providing aid to poor nations.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>MIT Center for International Studies</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does the United States have a “moral responsibility” for providing aid to poor nations — which have a significantly smaller carbon footprint and face catastrophic climate events at a much higher rate than wealthy countries?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03826-y" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;study&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; published Dec. 11 in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Climatic Change&lt;em&gt; explores U.S. public opinion on global climate policies considering our nation’s historic role as a leading contributor of carbon emissions. The randomized, experimental survey specifically investigates American attitudes toward such a moral responsibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The work was led by MIT Professor Evan Lieberman, the Total Chair on Contemporary African Politics and director of the MIT Center for International Studies, and Volha Charnysh, the Ford Career Development Associate Professor of Political Science, and was co-authored with MIT political science PhD student Jared Kalow and University of Pennsylvania postdoc Erin Walk PhD ’24. Here, Lieberman describes the team's research and insights, and offers recommendations that could result in more effective climate advocacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What are the key findings — and any surprises — of your recent work on climate attitudes among the U.S. population?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;A big question at the COP29 Climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan was:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/climate/cop24-climate-finance.html"&gt;Who will pay the trillions of dollars needed&lt;/a&gt; to help lower-income countries adapt to climate change? During past meetings, global leaders have come to an increasing consensus that the wealthiest countries should pay, but there has been little follow-through on commitments. In countries like the United States, popular opinion about such policies can weigh heavily on politicians' minds, as citizens focus on their own challenges at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda is one of many who views such transfers as a matter of moral responsibility,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/climate/cop24-climate-finance.html"&gt;explaining&lt;/a&gt; that many rich countries see climate finance as “a random act of charity ... not recognizing that they have a moral obligation to provide funding, especially the historical emitters and even those who currently have large emissions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In our study, we set out to measure American attitudes towards climate-related foreign aid, and explicitly to test the impact of this particular moral responsibility narrative. We did this on an experimental basis, so subjects were randomly assigned to receive different messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One message emphasized what we call a “climate justice” frame, and it argued that Americans should contribute to helping poor countries because of the United States’ disproportionate role in the emissions of greenhouse gasses that have led to global warming. That message had a positive impact on the extent to which citizens supported the use of foreign aid for climate adaptation in poor countries. However, when we looked at who was actually moved by the message, we found that the effect was larger and statistically significant only among Democrats, but not among Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We were surprised that a message emphasizing solidarity, the idea that “we are all in this together,” had no overall effect on citizen attitudes, Democrats or Republicans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What are your recommendations toward addressing the attitudes on global climate policies within the U.S.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;First, given limited budgets and attention for communications campaigns, our research certainly suggests that emphasizing a bit of blaming and shaming is more powerful than more diffuse messages of shared responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But our research also emphasized how critically important it is to find new ways to communicate with Republicans about climate change and about foreign aid. Republicans were overwhelmingly less supportive of climate aid and yet even from that low baseline, a message that moved Democrats had a much more mixed reception among Republicans. Researchers and those working on the front lines of climate communications need to do more to better understand Republican perspectives. Younger Republicans, for example, might be more movable on key climate policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;With an incoming Trump administration, what are some of the specific hurdles and/or opportunities we face in garnering U.S. public support for international climate negotiations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Not only did Trump demonstrate his disdain for international action on climate change by withdrawing from the Paris agreement during his first term in office, but he has indicated his intention to double down on such strategies in his second term. And the idea that he would support assistance for the world’s poorest countries harmed by climate change? This seems unlikely. Because we find Republican public opinion so firmly in line with these perspectives, frankly, it is hard to be optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Those Americans concerned with the effects of climate change may need to look to state-level, non-government, corporate, and more global organizations to support climate justice efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Are there any other takeaways you’d like to share?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Those working in the climate change area may need to rethink how we talk and message about the challenges the world faces. Right now, almost anything that sounds like “climate change” is likely to be rejected by Republican leaders and large segments of American society. Our approach of experimenting with different types of messages is a relatively low-cost strategy for identifying more promising strategies, targeted at Americans and at citizens in other wealthy countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But our study, in line with other work, also demonstrates that partisanship — identifying as a Republican or Democrat — is by far the strongest predictor of attitudes toward climate aid. While climate justice messaging can move attitudes slightly, the effects are still modest relative to the contributions of party identification itself.&amp;nbsp;Just as Republican party elites were once &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/26/us/helms-reverses-opposition-to-help-on-aids.html"&gt;persuaded to take leadership in the global fight against HIV and AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, a similar challenge lies ahead for climate aid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the old saw has it, 90 percent of politics is just showing up. Which is fine for people who are already engaged in the political system and expect to influence it. What about everyone else? The U.S. has millions and millions of people who typically do not vote or participate in politics. Is there a way into political life for those who are normally disconnected from it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a topic MIT political scientist Ariel White has been studying closely over the last decade. White conducts careful empirical research on typically overlooked subjects, such as the relationship between incarceration and political participation; the way people interact with government administrators; and how a variety of factors, from media coverage to income inequality, influence engagement with politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the media heavily cover the views of frequent voters in certain areas, there is very little attention paid to citizens who do not vote regularly but could. To grasp U.S. politics, it might help us to better understand such people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there is a much broader story to be told here,” says White, an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Political Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study by study, her research has been telling that story. Even short, misdemeanor-linked jail terms, White has found, reduce the likelihood that people will vote — and lower the propensity of family members to vote as well. When people are convicted of felonies, they often lose their right to vote, but they also vote at low rates when eligible. Other studies by White also suggest that an 8 percent minimum wage increase leads to an increase in turnout of about one-third of 1 percent, and that those receiving public benefits are far less likely to vote than those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These issues are often viewed in partisan terms, although the reality, White thinks, is considerably more complex. When evaluating infrequent or disconnected voters, we do not know enough to make assumptions about these matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting people with past criminal convictions registered and voting, when they are eligible, is not a surefire partisan advantage for anybody,” White says. “There’s a lot of heterogeneity in this group, which is not what people assume. Legislators tend to treat this as a partisan issue, but at the mass public level you see less polarization, and more people are willing to support a path for others back into daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experiences matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White grew up near Rochester, New York, and majored in economics and government at Cornell University. She says that initially she never considered entering academia, and tried her hand at a few jobs after graduation. One of them, working as an Americorps-funded paralegal in a legal services office, had a lasting influence; she started thinking more about the nature of government-citizen interactions in these settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really stuck in my mind the way people’s experiences, one-on-one with a person who is representing government, when trying to get benefits, really shapes people’s views about how government is going to operate and see them, and what they can expect from the state,” White says. “People’s experiences with government matter for what they do politically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long, White was accepted into the doctoral program at Harvard University, where she earned an MA in 2012 and her PhD in 2016. White then joined the MIT faculty, also in 2016, and has remained at the Institute ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White’s first published paper, in 2015, co-authored with Julie Faller and Noah Nathan, found that government officials tended to have different levels of responsiveness when providing voting information to people of apparently different ethnicities. It won an award from the American Political Science Association. (Nathan is now also a faculty member at MIT.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, White has published a string of papers examining how many factors interact with voting propensities. In one study focused in Pennsylvania, she found that public benefits recipients made up 20 percent of eligible voters in 2020 but just 12 percent of those who voted. When examining the criminal justice system, White has found that even short-term jail time leads to a turnout drop of several percentage points among the incarcerated. Family members of those serving even short jail sentences are less likely to vote in the near term too, although their participation rebounds over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t often think of incarceration as a thing they connect with politics,” White says. “Descriptively, with many people who have had the experience of incarceration or criminal convictions, or who are living in families or neighborhoods with a lot of it, we don’t see a lot of political action, and we see low levels of voting. Given how widespread incarceration is in the U.S., it seems like one of the most common and impactful things the government can do. But for a long time it was left to sociology to study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to reach people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having determined that citizens are less likely to vote in many circumstances, White’s research is now evolving toward a related question: What are the most viable ways of changing that? To be sure, nothing is likely to create a tsunami of new voters. Even where people convicted of felonies can vote from prison, she found in still another study, they do so at single-digit rates. People who are used to not voting are not going to start voting at high rates, on aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this fall, White led a new field experiment about getting unregistered voters to both register and vote. In this case, she and some colleagues created a study designed to see if friends of unregistered voters might be especially able to get their networks to join the voter rolls. The results are still under review. But for White, it is a new area where many kinds of experiments and studies seem possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Political science in general and the world of actual practicing political campaigns knows an awful lot about how to get registered voters to turn out to vote,” White says. “There’s so much work on get-out-the-vote activities, mailers and calls and texts. We know way, way less about the 1-in-4 or so eligible voters who are simply not registered at all, and are in a very real sense invisible in the political landscape. Overwhelmingly, the people I’m curious about fall into that category.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also a subject that she hopes will sustain the interest of her students. White’s classes tend to be filled by students with many different registered majors but an abiding interest in civic life. White wants them to come away with a more informed sense of their civic landscape, as well as new tools for conducting clean empirical studies. And, who knows? Like White herself, some of her students may end up making a career out of political engagement, even if they don’t know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really like working with MIT students,” White says. “I do hope my students gain some key understandings about what we know about political life, and how we can know about it, which I think are likely to be helpful to them in a variety of realms. My hope is they take a fundamental understanding of social science research, and some big questions, and some big concepts, out into the world.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Why open secrets are a big problem</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Philosopher Sam Berstler diagnoses the corrosive effects of not acknowledging troubling truths.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imagine that the head of a company office is misbehaving, and a disillusioned employee reports the problem to their manager. Instead of the complaint getting traction, however, the manager sidesteps the issue and implies that raising it further could land the unhappy employee in trouble — but doesn’t deny that the problem exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hypothetical scenario involves an open secret: a piece of information that is widely known but never acknowledged as such. Open secrets often create practical quandaries for people, as well as backlash against those who try to address the things that the secrets protect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a newly published paper, MIT philosopher Sam Berstler contends that open secrets are pervasive and problematic enough to be worthy of systematic study — and provides a detailed analysis of the distinctive social dynamics accompanying them. In many cases, she proposes, ignoring some things is fine — but open secrets present a special problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, people might maintain friendships better by not disclosing their salaries to each other, and relatives might get along better if they avoid talking politics at the holidays. But these are just run-of-the-mill individual decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, open secrets are especially damaging, Berstler believes, because of their “iterative” structure. We do not talk about open secrets; we do not talk about the fact that we do not talk about them; and so on, until the possibility of addressing the problems at hand disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes not acknowledging things can be very productive,” Berstler says. “It’s good we don’t talk about everything in the workplace. What’s different about open secrecy is not the content of what we’re not acknowledging, but the pernicious iterative structure of our practice of not acknowledging it.&amp;nbsp; And because of that structure, open secrecy tends to be hard to change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, as she writes in the paper, “Open secrecy norms are often moral disasters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Berstler says, the example of open secrets should enable us to examine the nature of conversation itself in more multidimensional terms; we need to think about the things left unsaid in conversation, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berstler’s paper, “&lt;a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/BERTSO-68" target="_blank"&gt;The Structure of Open Secrets&lt;/a&gt;,” appears in advance online form in &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Review&lt;/em&gt;. Berstler, an assistant professor and the Laurance S. Rockefeller Career Development Chair in MIT’s Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, is the sole author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eroding our knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of open secrets is hardly new, but it has not been subject to extensive philosophical rigor. The German sociologist Georg Simmel wrote about them in the early 20th century, but mostly in the context of secret societies keeping quirky rituals to themselves. Other prominent thinkers have addressed open secrets in psychological terms. To Berstler, the social dynamics of open secrets merit a more thorough reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a psychological problem that people are having,” she says. “It’s a particular practice that they’re all conforming to. But it’s hard to see this because it’s the kind of practice that members, just in virtue of conforming to the practice, can’t talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Berstler’s view, the iterative nature of open secrets distinguishes them. The employee expecting a candid reply from their manager may feel bewildered about the lack of a transparent response, and that nonacknowledgement means there is not much recourse to be had, either. Eventually, keeping open secrets means the original issue itself can be lost from view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Open secrets norms are set up to try to erode our knowledge,” Berstler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, people may avoid addressing open secrets head-on because they face a familiar quandary: Being a whistleblower can cost people their jobs and more. But Berstler suggests in the paper that keeping open secrets helps people define their in-group status, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also the basis for group identity,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berstler avoids taking the position that greater transparency is automatically a beneficial thing.&amp;nbsp;The paper identifies at least one kind of special case where keeping open secrets might be good. Suppose, for instance, a co-worker has an eccentric but harmless habit their colleagues find out about: It might be gracious to spare them simple embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That aside, as Berstler writes, open secrets “can serve as shields for powerful people guilty of serious, even criminal wrongdoing. The norms can compound the harm that befalls their victims … [who] find they don’t just&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;have to contend with the perpetrator’s financial resources, political might, and interpersonal capital. They must go up against an entire social arrangement.” As a result, the chances of fixing social or organizational dysfunction diminish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two layers of conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berstler is not only trying to chart the dynamics and problems of open secrets. She is also trying to usefully complicate our ideas about the nature of conversations and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, some philosophers have theorized about conversations and communication by focusing largely on the information being shared among people. To Berstler, this is not quite sufficient; the example of open secrets alerts us that communication is not just an act of making things more and more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I’m arguing in the paper is that this is too simplistic a way to think about it, because actual conversations in the real world have a theatrical or dramatic structure,” Berstler says. “There are things that cannot be made explicit without ruining the performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an office holiday party, for instance, the company CEO might maintain an illusion of being on equal footing with the rest of the employees if the conversation is restricted to movies and television shows. If the subject turns to year-end bonuses, that illusion vanishes. Or two friends at a party, trapped in an unwanted conversation with a third person, might maneuver themselves away with knowing comments, but without explicitly saying they are trying to end the chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here Berstler draws upon the work of sociologist Erving Goffman — who closely studied the performative aspects of everyday behavior — to outline how a more multi-dimensional conception of social interaction applies to open secrets. Berstler suggests open secrets involve what she calls “activity layering,” which in this case suggests that people in a conversation involving open secrets have multiple common grounds for understanding, but some remain unspoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further expanding on Goffman’s work, Berstler also details how people may be “mutually collaborating on a pretense,” as she writes, to keep an open secret going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Goffman has not really systematically been brought into the philosophy of language, so I am showing how his ideas illuminate and complicate philosophical views,” Berstler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined, a close analysis of open secrets and a re-evaluation of the performative components of conversation can help us become more cognizant about communication. What is being said matters; what is left unsaid matters alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are structural features of open secrets that are worrisome,” Berstler says. “And because of that we have to more aware [of how they work].”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Terri Park | MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frida Polli, a neuroscientist, entrepreneur, investor, and inventor known for her leading-edge contributions at the crossroads of behavioral science and artificial intelligence, is MIT’s new visiting innovation scholar for the 2024-25 academic year. She is the first visiting innovation scholar to be housed within the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polli began her career in academic neuroscience with a focus on multimodal brain imaging related to health and disease. She was a fellow at the Psychiatric Neuroimaging Group at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School. She then joined the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT as a postdoc, where she worked with John Gabrieli, the Grover Hermann Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and a professor of brain and cognitive sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her research has won many awards, including a Young Investigator Award from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation. She authored over 30 peer-reviewed articles, with notable publications in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;. She transitioned from academia to entrepreneurship by completing her MBA at the Harvard Business School (HBS) as a Robert Kaplan Life Science Fellow. During this time, she also won the Life Sciences Track and the Audience Choice Award in the 2010 MIT $100K Entrepreneurship competition as a member of Aukera Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After HBS, Polli launched pymetrics, which harnessed advancements in cognitive science and machine learning to develop analytics-driven decision-making and performance enhancement software for the human capital sector. She holds multiple patents for the technology developed at pymetrics, which she co-founded in 2012 and led as CEO until her successful exit in 2022.&amp;nbsp;Pymetrics was a World Economic Forum’s Technology Pioneer and Global Innovator, an Inc. 5000’s Fastest-Growing company, and Forbes Artificial Intelligence 50 company.&amp;nbsp;Polli and pymetrics also played a pivotal role in passing the first-in-the-nation algorithmic bias law — New York’s Automated Employment Decision Tool law — which went into effect in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making her return to MIT as a visiting innovation scholar, Polli is collaborating closely with Sendhil Mullainathan, the Peter de Florez Professor in the departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Economics, and a principal investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems. With Mullainathan, she is working to bring together a broad array of faculty, students, and postdocs across MIT to address concrete problems where &lt;a href="https://tot.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;humans and algorithms intersect&lt;/a&gt;, to develop a new subdomain of computer science specific to behavioral science, and to train the next generation of scientists to be bilingual in these two fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you get unreasonably lucky. Frida has thrived in each of the facets we’re looking to have impact in — academia, civil society, and the marketplace. She combines a startup mentality with an abiding interest in positive social impact, while capable of ensuring the kind of intellectual rigor MIT demands. It’s an exceptionally rare combination, one we are unreasonably lucky to have,” says Mullainathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are increasingly interacting with algorithms, often with poor results, because most algorithms are not built with human interplay in mind,” says Polli. “We will focus on designing algorithms that will work synergistically with people. Only such algorithms can help us address large societal challenges in education, health care, poverty, et cetera.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polli was recognized as one of &lt;em&gt;Inc.'s&lt;/em&gt; Top 100 Female Founders in 2019, followed by being named to &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneur's&lt;/em&gt; Top 100 Powerful Women in 2020, and to the 2024 list of 100 Brilliant Women in AI Ethics. Her work has been highlighted by major outlets including &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond her role at pymetrics, she founded Alethia AI in 2023, an organization focused on promoting transparency in technology, and in 2024, she launched Rosalind Ventures, dedicated to investing in women founders in science and health care. She is also an advisor at the Buck Institute’s Center for Healthy Aging in Women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm delighted to welcome Dr. Polli back to MIT. As a bilingual expert in both behavioral science and AI, she is a natural fit for the college. Her entrepreneurial background makes her a terrific inaugural visiting innovation scholar,” says Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Henry Ellis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Miracle, or marginal gain?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Industrial policy is said to have sparked huge growth in East Asia. Two MIT economists say the numbers tell a more complex story. ]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From 1960 to 1989, South Korea experienced a famous economic boom, with real GDP per capita growing by an annual average of 6.82 percent. Many observers have attributed this to industrial policy, the practice of giving government support to specific industrial sectors. In this case, industrial policy is often thought to have powered a generation of growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did it, though? An innovative study by four scholars, including two MIT economists, suggests that overall GDP growth attributable to industrial policy is relatively limited. Using global trade data to evaluate changes in industrial capacity within countries, the research finds that industrial policy raises long-run GDP by only 1.08 percent in generally favorable circumstances, and up to 4.06 percent if additional factors are aligned — a distinctly smaller gain than an annually compounding rate of 6.82 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is meaningful not just because of the bottom-line numbers, but for the reasons behind them. The research indicates, for instance, that local consumer demand can curb the impact of industrial policy. Even when a country alters its output, demand for those goods may not shift as extensively, putting a ceiling on directed growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In most cases, the gains are not going to be enormous,” says MIT economist Arnaud Costinot, co-author of a new paper detailing the research. “They are there, but in terms of magnitude, the gains are nowhere near the full scope of the South Korean experience, which is the poster child for an industrial policy success story.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research combines empirical data and economic theory, using data to assess “textbook” conditions where industrial policy would seem most merited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many think that, for countries like China, Japan, and other East Asian giants, and perhaps even the U.S., some form of industrial policy played a big role in their success stories,” says Dave Donaldson, an MIT economist and another co-author of the paper. “The question is whether the textbook argument for industrial policy fully explains those successes, and our punchline would be, no, we don’t think it can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/734129" target="_blank"&gt;The Textbook Case for Industrial Policy: Theory Meets Data&lt;/a&gt;,” appears in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Political Economy&lt;/em&gt;. The authors are Dominick Bartelme, an independent researcher; Costinot, the Ford Professor of Economics in MIT’s Department of Economics; Donaldson, the Class of 1949 Professor of Economics in MIT’s Department of Economics; and Andres Rodriguez-Clare, the Edward G. and Nancy S. Jordan Professor of Economics at the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse-engineering new insights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opponents of industrial policy have long advocated for a more market-centered approach to economics. And yet, over the last several decades globally, even where political leaders publicly back a laissez-faire approach, many governments have still found reasons to support particular industries. Beyond that, people have long cited East Asia’s economic rise as a point in favor of industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholars say the “textbook case” for industrial policy is a scenario where some economic sectors are subject to external economies of scale but others are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means firms within an industry have an external effect on the productivity of other firms in that same industry, which could happen via the spread of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an industry becomes both bigger and more productive, it may make cheaper goods that can be exported more competitively. The study is based on the insight that global trade statistics can tell us something important about the changes in industry-specific capacities within countries. That — combined with other metrics about national economies — allows the economists to scrutinize the overall gains deriving from those changes and to assess the possible scope of industrial policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Donaldson explains, “An empirical lever here is to ask: If something makes a country’s sectors bigger, do they look more productive? If so, they would start exporting more to other countries. We reverse-engineer that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costinot adds: “We are using that idea that if productivity is going up, that should be reflected in export patterns. The smoking gun for the existence of scale effects is that larger domestic markets go hand in hand with more exports.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the scholars analyzed data for 61 countries at different points in time over the last few decades, with exports for 15 manufacturing sectors included. The figure of 1.08 percent long-run GDP gains is an average, with countries realizing gains ranging from 0.59 percent to 2.06 percent annually under favorable conditions. Smaller countries that are open to trade may realize larger proportional effects as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re doing this global analysis and trying to be right on average,” Donaldson says. “It’s possible there are larger gains from industrial policy in particular settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggests countries have greater room to redirect economic activity, based on varying levels of productivity among industries, than they can realistically enact due to relatively fixed demand. The paper estimates that if countries could fully reallocate workers to the industry with the largest room to grow, long-run welfare gains would be as high as 12.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that never happens. Suppose a country’s industrial policy helped one sector double in size while becoming 20 percent more productive. In theory, the government should continue to back that industry. In reality, growth would slow as markets became saturated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That would be a pretty big scale effect,” Donaldson says. “But notice that in doubling the size of an industry, many forces would push back. Maybe consumers don’t want to consume twice as many manufactured goods. Just because there are large spillovers in productivity doesn’t mean optimally designed industrial policy has huge effects. It has to be in a world where people want those goods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place-based policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costinot and Donaldson both emphasize that this study does not address all the possible factors that can be weighed either in favor of industrial policy or against it. Some governments might favor industrial policy as a way of evening out wage distributions and wealth inequality, fixing other market failures such as environmental damages or furthering strategic geopolitical goals. In the U.S., industrial policy has sometimes been viewed as a way of revitalizing recently deindustrialized areas while reskilling workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In charting the limits on industrial policy stemming from fairly fixed demand, the study touches on still bigger issues concerning global demand and restrictions on growth of any kind. Without increasing demand, enterprise of all kinds encounters size limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the paper, in any case, is not necessarily a final conclusion about industrial policy, but deeper insight into its dynamics. As the authors note, the findings leave open the possibility that targeted interventions in specific sectors and specific regions could be very beneficial, when policy and trade conditions are right. Policymakers should grasp the amount of growth likely to result, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Costinot notes, “The conclusion is not that there is no potential gain from industrial policy, but just that the textbook case doesn’t seem to be there.” At least, not to the extent some have assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was supported, in part, by the U.S. National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Five MIT faculty members and two additional alumni were recently named to the &lt;a href="https://www.schmidtsciences.org/schmidt-sciences-to-award-12-million-to-advance-research-on-beneficial-ai/"&gt;2024 cohort of AI2050 Fellows.&lt;/a&gt; The honor is announced annually by Schmidt Sciences, Eric and Wendy Schmidt’s philanthropic initiative that aims to accelerate scientific innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conceived and co-chaired by Eric Schmidt and James Manyika, AI2050 is a philanthropic initiative aimed at helping to solve&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ai2050.schmidtsciences.org/hard-problems/"&gt;hard problems in AI&lt;/a&gt;. Within their research, each fellow will contend with the central motivating question of AI2050: “It’s 2050. AI has turned out to be hugely beneficial to society. What happened? What are the most important problems we solved and the opportunities and possibilities we realized to ensure this outcome?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s MIT-affiliated AI2050 Fellows include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/david-h-autor" target="_blank"&gt;David Autor&lt;/a&gt;, the Daniel (1972) and Gail Rubinfeld Professor in the MIT Department of Economics, and co-director of the MIT Shaping the Future of Work Initiative and the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Labor Studies Program, has been named a 2024 AI2050 senior fellow. His scholarship explores the labor-market impacts of technological change and globalization on job polarization, skill demands, earnings levels and inequality, and electoral outcomes. Autor’s AI2050 project will leverage real-time data on AI adoption to clarify how new tools interact with human capabilities in shaping employment and earnings. The work will provide an accessible framework for entrepreneurs, technologists, and policymakers seeking to understand, tangibly, how AI can complement human expertise. Autor has received numerous awards and honors, including a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship, and the Heinz 25th Special Recognition Award from the Heinz Family Foundation for his work “transforming our understanding of how globalization and technological change are impacting jobs and earning prospects for American workers.” In 2023, Autor was one of two researchers across all scientific fields selected as a NOMIS Distinguished Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://beerys.github.io/" target="_blank"&gt;Sara Beery&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in the Department of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a principal investigator in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), has been named an early career fellow. Beery’s work focuses on building computer vision methods that enable global-scale environmental and biodiversity monitoring across data modalities and tackling real-world challenges, including strong spatiotemporal correlations, imperfect data quality, fine-grained categories, and long-tailed distributions. She collaborates with nongovernmental organizations and government agencies to deploy her methods worldwide and works toward increasing the diversity and accessibility of academic research in artificial intelligence through interdisciplinary capacity-building and education. Beery earned a BS in electrical engineering and mathematics from Seattle University and a PhD in computing and mathematical sciences from Caltech, where she was honored with the Amori Prize for her outstanding dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mit.edu/~gfarina/about/" target="_blank"&gt;Gabriele Farina&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in EECS and a principal investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), has been named an early career fellow. Farina’s work lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, computer science, operations research, and economics. Specifically, he focuses on learning and optimization methods for sequential decisio­­­n-making and convex-concave saddle point problems, with applications to equilibrium finding in games. Farina also studies computational game theory and recently served as co-author on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;study&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;about combining language models with strategic reasoning. He is a recipient of a NeurIPS Best Paper Award and was a Facebook Fellow in economics and computer science. His dissertation was recognized with the 2023 ACM SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award and one of the two 2023 ACM Dissertation Award Honorable Mentions, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/" target="_blank"&gt;Marzyeh Ghassemi&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’17, an associate professor in EECS&amp;nbsp;and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, principal investigator at CSAIL and LIDS, and affiliate of the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, has been named an early career fellow.&amp;nbsp;Ghassemi’s research in the Healthy ML Group creates a rigorous quantitative framework in which to design, develop, and place ML models in a way that is robust and fair, focusing on health settings. Her contributions range from socially aware model construction to improving subgroup- and shift-robust learning methods to identifying important insights in model deployment scenarios that have implications in policy, health practice, and equity. Among other awards, Ghassemi has been named one of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 35 Innovators Under 35; and has been awarded the 2018 Seth J. Teller Award, the 2023 MIT Prize for Open Data, a 2024 NSF CAREER Award, and the Google Research Scholar Award. She founded the nonprofit Association for Health, Inference and Learning (AHLI) and her work has been featured in popular press such as &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/" target="_blank"&gt;Yoon Kim&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in EECS and a principal investigator in CSAIL, has been named an early career fellow. Kim’s work straddles the intersection between natural language processing and machine learning, and touches upon efficient training and deployment of large-scale models, learning from small data, neuro-symbolic approaches, grounded language learning, and connections between computational and human language processing. Affiliated with CSAIL, Kim earned his PhD in computer science at Harvard University; his MS in data science from New York University; his MA in statistics from Columbia University; and his BA in both math and economics from Cornell University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional alumni Roger Grosse PhD ’14, a computer science associate professor at the University of Toronto, and David Rolnick ’12, PhD ’18, assistant professor at Mila-Quebec AI Institute, were also named senior and early career fellows, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Danna Lorch | MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brought together as part of the &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt; (SERC) initiative within the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, a community of students known as &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/serc-scholars-program/"&gt;SERC Scholars&lt;/a&gt; is collaborating to examine the most urgent problems humans face in the digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each semester, students from all levels from across MIT are invited to join a different topical working group led by a SERC postdoctoral associate. Each group delves into a specific issue — such as surveillance or data ownership — culminating in a final project presented at the end of the term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, students complete the program with hands-on experience conducting research in a new cross-disciplinary field. However, one group of undergraduate and graduate students recently had the unique opportunity to enhance their resume by becoming published authors of a case study about the environmental and climate justice implications of the electronics hardware life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s not uncommon for graduate students to co-author case studies, it’s unusual for undergraduates to earn this opportunity — and for their audience to be other undergraduates around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team was insanely interdisciplinary,” says Anastasia Dunca, a junior studying computer science and one of the co-authors. “I joined the SERC Scholars Program&amp;nbsp;because I liked the idea of being part of a cohort from across MIT working on a project that utilized all of our skillsets. It also helps [undergraduates] learn the ins and outs of computing ethics research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case study co-author Jasmin Liu, an MBA student in the MIT Sloan School of Management,&amp;nbsp;sees&amp;nbsp;the program as a platform to learn about the intersection of technology, society, and ethics:&amp;nbsp;“I met team members spanning computer science, urban planning, to art/culture/technology. I was excited to work with a diverse team because I know complex problems must be approached with many different perspectives. Combining my background in humanities and business with the expertise of others allowed us to be more innovative and comprehensive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Rabe, a former SERC postdoc who facilitated the group, says, “I let the students take the lead on identifying the topic and conducting the research.” His goal for the group was to challenge students across disciplines to develop a working definition of climate justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From mining to e-waste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SERC Scholars’ case study, “&lt;a href="https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/w9ht6hue/release/5"&gt;From Mining to E-waste: The Environmental and Climate Justice Implications of the Electronics Hardware Life Cycle&lt;/a&gt;,” was published by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/"&gt;MIT Case Studies in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing case studies series, which releases new issues twice a year on an open-source platform, is enabling undergraduate instructors worldwide to incorporate research-based education materials on computing ethics into their existing class syllabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular case study broke down the electronics life cycle from mining to manufacturing, usage, and disposal. It offered an in-depth look at how this cycle promotes inequity in the Global South. Mining for the average of 60 minerals that power everyday devices lead to illegal deforestation, compromising air quality in the Amazon, and triggering armed conflict in Congo. Manufacturing leads to proven health risks for both formal and informal workers, some of whom are child laborers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life cycle assessment and circular economy are proposed as mechanisms for analyzing environmental and climate justice issues in the electronics life cycle. Rather than posing solutions, the case study offers readers entry points for further discussion and for assessing their own individual responsibility as producers of e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crufting and crafting a case study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunca joined Rabe's working group, intrigued by the invitation to conduct a rigorous literature review examining issues like data center resource and energy use, manufacturing waste, ethical issues with AI, and climate change. Rabe quickly realized that a common thread among all participants was an interest in understanding and reducing e-waste and its impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came in with the idea of us co-authoring a case study,” Rabe said. However, the writing-intensive process was initially daunting to those students who were used to conducting applied research. Once Rabe created sub-groups with discrete tasks, the steps for researching, writing, and iterating a case study became more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ellie Bultena, an undergraduate student studying linguistics and philosophy and a contributor to the study, that meant conducting field research on the loading dock of MIT’s Stata Center, where students and faculty go “crufting” through piles of clunky printers, broken computers, and used lab equipment discarded by the Institute's labs, departments, and individual users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not a formally sanctioned activity on-campus, “crufting” is the act of gleaning usable parts from these junk piles to be repurposed into new equipment or art. Bultena’s respondents, who opted to be anonymous, said that MIT could do better when it comes to the amount of e-waste generated and suggested that formal strategies could be implemented to encourage community members to repair equipment more easily or recycle more formally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabe, now an education program director at the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, is hopeful that through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sustainability.mit.edu/topic/zero-carbon-campus"&gt;Zero-Carbon Campus Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which commits MIT to eliminating all direct emissions by 2050, MIT will ultimately become a model for other higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the group lacked the time and resources to travel to communities in the Global South that they profiled in their case study, members leaned into exhaustive secondary research, collecting data on how some countries are irresponsibly dumping e-waste. In contrast, others have developed alternative solutions that can be duplicated elsewhere and scaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We source materials, manufacture them, and then throw them away,” Lelia Hampton says. A PhD candidate in electrical engineering and computer science and another co-author,&amp;nbsp;Hampton jumped at the opportunity to serve in a writing role, bringing together the sub-groups research findings. “I’d never written a case study, and it was exciting. Now I want to write 10 more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content directly informed Hampton’s dissertation research, which “looks at applying machine learning to climate justice issues such as urban heat islands.” She said that writing a case study that is accessible to general audiences upskilled her for the non-profit organization she’s determined to start. “It’s going to provide communities with free resources and data needed to understand how they are impacted by climate change and begin to advocate against injustice,” Hampton explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunca, Liu, Rabe, Bultena, and Hampton are joined on the case study by fellow authors Mrinalini Singha, a graduate student in the Art, Culture, and Technology program; Sungmoon Lim, a graduate student in urban studies and planning and EECS; Lauren Higgins, an undergraduate majoring in political science; and Madeline Schlegel, a Northeastern University co-op student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking the case study to classrooms around the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although PhD candidates have contributed to previous case studies in the series, this publication is the first to be co-authored with MIT undergraduates. Like any other peer-reviewed journal, before publication, the SERC Scholars’ case study was anonymously reviewed by senior scholars drawn from various fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series editor, David Kaiser, also served as one of SERC’s inaugural associate deans and helped shape the program. “The case studies, by design, are short, easy to read, and don't take up lots of time,” Kaiser explained. “They are gateways for students to explore, and instructors can cover a topic that has likely already been on their mind.” This semester, Kaiser, the Germeshausen Professor of the History of Science and a professor of physics, is teaching STS.004 (Intersections: Science, Technology, and the World), an undergraduate introduction to the field of science, technology, and society. The last month of the semester has been dedicated wholly to SERC case studies, one of which is:&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;“From Mining to E-Waste.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hampton was visibly moved to hear that the case study is being used at MIT but also by some of the 250,000 visitors to the SERC platform, many of whom are based in the Global South and directly impacted by the issues she and her cohort researched. “Many students are focused on climate, whether through computer science, data science, or mechanical engineering. I hope that this case study educates them on environmental and climate aspects of e-waste and computing.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT-affiliated winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes were celebrated in Stockholm, Sweden, as part of Nobel Week, which culminated with a grand &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-A4dUowT4Q" target="_blank"&gt;Nobel ceremony on Dec. 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s laureates with MIT ties include Daron Acemoglu, an Institute Professor, and Simon Johnson, the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship, who together &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-economists-daron-acemoglu-simon-johnson-nobel-prize-economics-1014"&gt;shared the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel&lt;/a&gt;, along with James Robinson of the University of Chicago, for their work on the relationship between economic growth and political institutions. MIT Department of Biology alumnus Victor Ambros ’75, PhD ’79 also shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Gary Ruvkun, who completed his postdoctoral research at the Institute alongside Ambros in the 1980s. The two were &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/victor-ambros-gary-ruvkun-share-nobel-prize-physiology-medicine-1007"&gt;honored for their discovery of MicroRNA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The honorees and their invited guests took part in a number of activities in Stockholm during this year’s Nobel Week, which began Dec. 5 with press conferences and a tour of special Nobel Week Lights around the city. Lectures, a visit to the Nobel Prize Museum, and a concert followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per tradition, the winners received their medals from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel. (Winners of the Nobel Peace Prize were honored on the same day in Oslo, Norway.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 105 MIT affiliates — including faculty, staff, alumni, and others — have won Nobel Prizes, according to MIT Institutional Research. Photos from the festivities appear below.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For all the talk about artificial intelligence upending the world, its economic effects remain uncertain. There is massive investment in AI but little clarity about what it will produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining AI has become a significant part of Nobel-winning economist Daron Acemoglu’s work. An Institute Professor at MIT, Acemoglu has long studied the impact of technology in society, from modeling the large-scale adoption of innovations to conducting empirical studies about the impact of robots on jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Acemoglu also shared the 2024 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel with two collaborators, Simon Johnson PhD ’89 of the MIT Sloan School of Management and James Robinson of the University of Chicago, for research on the relationship between political institutions and economic growth. Their work shows that democracies with robust rights sustain better growth over time than other forms of government do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of growth comes from technological innovation, the way societies use AI is of keen interest to Acemoglu, who has published a variety of papers about the economics of the technology in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where will the new tasks for humans with generative AI come from?” asks Acemoglu. “I don’t think we know those yet, and that’s what the issue is. What are the apps that are really going to change how we do things?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the measurable effects of AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1947, U.S. GDP growth has averaged about 3 percent annually, with productivity growth at about 2 percent annually. Some predictions have claimed AI will double growth or at least create a higher growth trajectory than usual. By contrast, in one paper, “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/advance-article/doi/10.1093/epolic/eiae042/7728473" target="_blank"&gt;The Simple Macroeconomics of AI&lt;/a&gt;,” published in the August issue of &lt;em&gt;Economic Policy&lt;/em&gt;, Acemoglu estimates that over the next decade, AI will produce a “modest increase” in GDP between 1.1 to 1.6 percent over the next 10 years, with a roughly 0.05 percent annual gain in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu’s assessment is based on recent estimates about how many jobs are affected by AI, including a 2023 study by researchers at OpenAI, OpenResearch, and the University of Pennsylvania, which finds that about 20 percent of U.S. job tasks might be exposed to AI capabilities. A 2024 study by researchers from MIT FutureTech, as well as the Productivity Institute and IBM, finds that about 23 percent of computer vision tasks that can be ultimately automated could be profitably done so within the next 10 years. Still more research suggests the average cost savings from AI is about 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to productivity, “I don’t think we should belittle 0.5 percent in 10 years. That’s better than zero,” Acemoglu says. “But it’s just disappointing relative to the promises that people in the industry and in tech journalism are making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this is an estimate, and additional AI applications may emerge: As Acemoglu writes in the paper, his calculation does not include the use of AI to predict the shapes of proteins — for which other scholars subsequently shared a Nobel Prize in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other observers have suggested that “reallocations” of workers displaced by AI will create additional growth and productivity, beyond Acemoglu’s estimate, though he does not think this will matter much. “Reallocations, starting from the actual allocation that we have, typically generate only small benefits,” Acemoglu says. “The direct benefits are the big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “I tried to write the paper in a very transparent way, saying what is included and what is not included. People can disagree by saying either the things I have excluded are a big deal or the numbers for the things included are too modest, and that’s completely fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which jobs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting such estimates can sharpen our intuitions about AI. Plenty of forecasts about AI have described it as revolutionary; other analyses are more circumspect. Acemoglu’s work helps us grasp on what scale we might expect changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s go out to 2030,” Acemoglu says. “How different do you think the U.S. economy is going to be because of AI? You could be a complete AI optimist and think that millions of people would have lost their jobs because of chatbots, or perhaps that some people have become super-productive workers because with AI they can do 10 times as many things as they’ve done before. I don’t think so. I think most companies are going to be doing more or less the same things. A few occupations will be impacted, but we’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that is right, then AI most likely applies to a bounded set of white-collar tasks, where large amounts of computational power can process a lot of inputs faster than humans can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, et cetera,” Acemoglu adds. “And those are essentially about 5 percent of the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Acemoglu and Johnson have sometimes been regarded as skeptics of AI, they view themselves as realists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying not to be bearish,” Acemoglu says. “There are things generative AI can do, and I believe that, genuinely.” However, he adds, “I believe there are ways we could use generative AI better and get bigger gains, but I don’t see them as the focus area of the industry at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine usefulness, or worker replacement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Acemoglu says we could be using AI better, he has something specific in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his crucial concerns about AI is whether it will take the form of “machine usefulness,” helping workers gain productivity, or whether it will be aimed at mimicking general intelligence in an effort to replace human jobs. It is the difference between, say, providing new information to a biotechnologist versus replacing a customer service worker with automated call-center technology. So far, he believes, firms have been focused on the latter type of case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My argument is that we currently have the wrong direction for AI,” Acemoglu says. “We’re using it too much for automation and not enough for providing expertise and information to workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu and Johnson delve into this issue in depth in their high-profile 2023 book “Power and Progress” (PublicAffairs), which has a straightforward&amp;nbsp;leading question: Technology creates economic growth, but who captures that economic growth? Is it elites, or do workers share in the gains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Acemoglu and Johnson make abundantly clear, they favor technological innovations that increase worker productivity while keeping people employed, which should sustain growth better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But generative AI, in Acemoglu’s view, focuses on mimicking whole people. This yields something he has for years been calling “so-so technology,” applications that perform at best only a little better than humans, but save companies money. Call-center automation is not always more productive than people; it just costs firms less than workers do. AI applications that complement workers seem generally on the back burner of the big tech players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think complementary uses of AI will miraculously appear by themselves unless the industry devotes significant energy and time to them,” Acemoglu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does history suggest about AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that technologies are often designed to replace workers is the focus of another recent paper by Acemoglu and Johnson, “&lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-091823-025129" target="_blank"&gt;Learning from Ricardo and Thompson: Machinery and Labor in the Early Industrial Revolution — and in the Age of AI&lt;/a&gt;,” published in August in &lt;em&gt;Annual Reviews in Economics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article addresses current debates over AI, especially claims that even if technology replaces workers, the ensuing growth will almost inevitably benefit society widely over time. England during the Industrial Revolution is sometimes cited as a case in point. But Acemoglu and Johnson contend that spreading the benefits of technology does not happen easily. In 19th-century England, they assert, it occurred only after decades of social struggle and worker action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wages are unlikely to rise when workers cannot push for their share of productivity growth,” Acemoglu and Johnson write in the paper. “Today, artificial intelligence may boost average productivity, but it also may replace many workers while degrading job quality for those who remain employed. … The impact of automation on workers today is more complex than an automatic linkage from higher productivity to better wages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper’s title refers to the social historian E.P Thompson and economist David Ricardo; the latter is often regarded as the discipline’s second-most influential thinker ever, after Adam Smith. Acemoglu and Johnson assert that Ricardo’s views went through their own evolution on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“David Ricardo made both his academic work and his political career by arguing that machinery was going to create this amazing set of productivity improvements, and it would be beneficial for society,” Acemoglu says. “And then at some point, he changed his mind, which shows he could be really open-minded. And he started writing about how if machinery replaced labor and didn’t do anything else, it would be bad for workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intellectual evolution, Acemoglu and Johnson contend, is telling us something meaningful today: There are not forces that inexorably guarantee broad-based benefits from technology, and we should follow the evidence about AI’s impact, one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best speed for innovation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If technology helps generate economic growth, then fast-paced innovation might seem ideal, by delivering growth more quickly. But in another paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20230353" target="_blank"&gt;Regulating Transformative Technologies&lt;/a&gt;,” from the September issue of &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review: Insights&lt;/em&gt;, Acemoglu and MIT doctoral student Todd Lensman suggest an alternative outlook. If some technologies contain both benefits and drawbacks, it is best to adopt them at a more measured tempo, while those problems are being mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If social damages are large and proportional to the new technology’s productivity, a higher growth rate paradoxically leads to slower optimal adoption,” the authors write in the paper. Their model suggests that, optimally, adoption should happen more slowly at first and then accelerate over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Market fundamentalism and technology fundamentalism might claim you should always go at the maximum speed for technology,” Acemoglu says. “I don’t think there’s any rule like that in economics. More deliberative thinking, especially to avoid harms and pitfalls, can be justified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those harms and pitfalls could include damage to the job market, or the rampant spread of misinformation. Or&amp;nbsp;AI might harm consumers, in areas from online advertising to online gaming. Acemoglu examines these scenarios in another paper,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20230589" target="_blank"&gt;When Big Data Enables Behavioral Manipulation&lt;/a&gt;,” forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review: Insights&lt;/em&gt;; it is co-authored with Ali Makhdoumi of Duke University, Azarakhsh Malekian of the University of Toronto, and Asu Ozdaglar of MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we are using it as a manipulative tool, or too much for automation and not enough for providing expertise and information to workers, then we would want a course correction,” Acemoglu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly others might claim innovation has less of a downside or is unpredictable enough that we should not apply any handbrakes to it. And Acemoglu and Lensman, in the September paper, are simply developing a model of innovation adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model is a response to a trend of the last decade-plus, in which many technologies are hyped are inevitable and celebrated because of their disruption. By contrast, Acemoglu and Lensman are suggesting we can reasonably judge the tradeoffs involved in particular technologies and aim to spur additional discussion about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we reach the right speed for AI adoption?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the idea is to adopt technologies more gradually, how would this occur?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, Acemoglu says, “government regulation has that role.” However, it is not clear what kinds of long-term guidelines for AI might be adopted in the U.S. or around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, he adds, if the cycle of “hype” around AI diminishes, then the rush to use it “will naturally slow down.” This may well be more likely than regulation, if AI does not produce profits for firms soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason why we’re going so fast is the hype from venture capitalists and other investors, because they think we’re going to be closer to artificial general intelligence,” Acemoglu says. “I think that hype is making us invest badly in terms of the technology, and many businesses are being influenced too early, without knowing what to do. We wrote that paper to say, look, the macroeconomics of it will benefit us if we are more deliberative and understanding about what we’re doing with this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Acemoglu emphasizes, hype is a tangible aspect of the economics of AI, since it drives investment in a particular vision of AI, which influences the AI tools we may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The faster you go, and the more hype you have, that course correction becomes less likely,” Acemoglu says. “It’s very difficult, if you’re driving 200 miles an hour, to make a 180-degree turn.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>3 Questions: Community policing in the Global South</title>

  <description><![CDATA[International research co-led by Professor Fotini Christia finds an approach lauded in the US works differently in other regions.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The concept of community policing gained wide acclaim in the U.S. when crime dropped drastically during the 1990s. In Chicago, Boston, and elsewhere, police departments established programs to build more local relationships, to better enhance community security. But how well does community policing work in other places? A new multicountry experiment co-led by MIT political scientist Fotini Christia found, perhaps surprisingly, that the policy had no impact in several countries across the Global South, from Africa to South America and Asia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results are detailed in a new edited volume, “Crime, Insecurity, and Community Policing: Experiments on Building Trust,” published this week by Cambridge University Press. The editors are Christia, the Ford International Professor of the Social Sciences in MIT’s Department of Political Science, director of the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, and director of the MIT Sociotechnical Systems Research Center; Graeme Blair of the University of California at Los Angeles; and Jeremy M. Weinstein of Stanford University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; talked to Christia about the project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is community policing, and how and where did you study it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The general idea is that community policing, actually connecting the police and the community they are serving in direct ways, is very effective. Many of us have celebrated community policing, and we typically think of the 1990s Chicago and Boston experiences, where community policing was implemented and seen as wildly successful in reducing crime rates, gang violence, and homicide.&amp;nbsp;This model has been broadly exported across the world, even though we don’t have much evidence that it works in contexts that have different resource capacities and institutional footprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study aims to understand if the hype around community policing is justified by measuring the effects of such policies globally, through field experiments, in six different settings in the Global South. In the same way that MIT’s &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/" target="_blank"&gt;J-PAL&lt;/a&gt; develops field experiments about an array of development interventions, we created programs, in cooperation with local governments, about policing. We studied if it works and how, across very diverse settings, including Uganda and Liberia in Africa, Colombia and Brazil in Latin America, and the Philippines and Pakistan in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, and book, is the result of collaborations with many police agencies. We also highlight how one can work with the police to understand and refine police practices&amp;nbsp;and think very intentionally about all the ethical considerations around such collaborations. The researchers designed the interventions alongside six teams of academics who conducted the experiments, so the book also reflects an interesting experiment in how to put together a collaboration like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What did you find?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; What was fascinating was that we found that locally designed community policing interventions did not generate greater trust or cooperation between citizens and the police, and did not reduce crime in the six regions of the Global South where we carried out our research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We looked at an array of different measures to evaluate the impact, such as changes in crime victimization, perceptions of police, as well as crime reporting, among others, and did not see any reductions in crime, whether measured in administrative data or in victimization surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The null effects were not driven by concerns of police noncompliance with the intervention, crime displacement, or any heterogeneity in effects across sites, including individual experiences with the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there is a bias against publishing so-called null results. But because we could show that it wasn’t due to methodological concerns, and because we were able to explain how such changes in resource-constrained environments would have to be preceded by structural reforms, the finding has been received as particularly compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why did community policing not have an impact in these countries?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We felt that it was important to analyze why it doesn’t work. In the book, we highlight three challenges. One involves capacity issues: This is the developing world, and there are low-resource issues to begin with, in terms of the programs police can implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second challenge is the principal-agent problem, the fact that the incentives of the police may not align in this case. For example,&amp;nbsp;a station commander and supervisors may not appreciate the importance of adopting community policing, and line officers&amp;nbsp;might not comply. Agency problems within the police are complex when it comes to mechanisms of accountability, and this may undermine the effectiveness of community policing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third challenge we highlight is the fact that, to the communities they serve, the police might not seem separate from the actual government.&amp;nbsp;So, it may not be clear if police are seen as independent institutions acting in the best interest of the citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We faced a lot of pushback when we were first presenting our results. The potential benefits of community policing is a story that resonates with many of us; it’s a narrative suggesting that connecting the police to a community has a&amp;nbsp;significant and substantively positive effect. But the outcome didn’t come as a surprise to people from the Global South. They felt the lack of resources, and potential problems about autonomy and nonalignment, were real.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mlen-Too Wesley has faded memories of his early childhood in Liberia, but the sharpest one has shaped his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wesley was 4 years old when he and his family boarded a military airplane to flee the West African nation. At the time, the country was embroiled in a 14-year civil war that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Mar/20/2003416574/-1/-1/0/20240306_LIBERIANCIVILWAR_1989-96.PDF"&gt;killed&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;approximately 200,000 people,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/stories/unhcr-completes-repatriation-155-000-liberians#:~:text=During%20Liberia%27s%20civil%20war%2C%20which%20broke%20out%20in%20December%201989%2C%20some%20750%2C000%20civilians%20became%20either%20internally%20displaced%20or%20refugees.%20Some%20refugees%20spent%20more%20than%20two%20decades%20in%20countries%20such%20as%20C%C3%B4te%20d%27Ivoire%2C%20the%20Gambia%2C%20Ghana%2C%20Guinea%2C%20Mali%2C%20Nigeria%2C%20Sierra%20Leone%20and%20Togo"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; about 750,000, and starved countless more. When Wesley’s grandmother told him he would enjoy a meal during his flight, Wesley knew his fortune had changed. Yet, his first instinct was to&amp;nbsp;offer his food to the people he left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I made a decision right then to come back,” Wesley says. “Even as I grew older and spent more time in the United States, I knew I wanted to contribute to Liberia’s future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today, the 38-year-old is committed to empowering Liberians through economic growth. Wesley looked to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/"&gt;MITx MicroMasters program in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy&lt;/a&gt; (DEDP) to achieve that goal. He examined issues such as micro-lending, state capture, and investment in health care in courses such as &lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+14.740x/" target="_blank"&gt;Foundations of Development Policy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+14.009x/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Economics for Hard Times&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+14.73x/" target="_blank"&gt;The Challenges of Global Poverty&lt;/a&gt;. Through case studies and research, Wesley discovered that economic incentives can encourage desired behaviors, curb corruption, and empower people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I couldn’t connect the dots”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Liberia is marred by corruption. According to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://images.transparencycdn.org/images/CPI-2023-Report.pdf"&gt;Transparency International’s Corruptions Perception Index for 2023&lt;/a&gt;, Liberia scored 25 out of 100, with zero signifying the highest level of corruption. Yet, Wesley grew tired of textbooks and undergraduate professors saying that the status of Liberia and other African nations could be blamed entirely on corruption. Even worse, these sources gave Wesley the impression that nothing could be done to improve his native country. The sentiment frustrated him, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It struck me as flippant to attribute the challenges faced by billions of people to backward behaviors,” says Wesley. “There are several forces, internal and external, that have contributed to Liberia’s condition. If we really examine them, explore why things happened, and define the change we want, we can plot a way forward to a more prosperous future.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Driven to examine the economic, political, and social dynamics shaping his homeland and to fulfill his childhood promise, Wesley moved back to Africa in 2013. Over the next 10 years, he merged his interests in entrepreneurship, software development, and economics to better Liberia. He designed a forestry management platform that preserves Liberia’s natural resources, built an online queue for government hospitals to triage patients more effectively, and engineered data visualization tools to support renewable energy initiatives. Yet, to create the impact Wesley wanted, he needed to do more than collect data. He had to analyze and act on it in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I couldn’t connect the dots on why things are the way they are,” Wesley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It wasn't just an academic experience for me”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wesley knew he needed to dive deeper into data science, and looked to the MicroMasters in DEDP program to help him connect the dots. Established in 2017 by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) and MIT Open Learning, the MicroMasters in DEDP program is based on the Nobel Prize-winning work of MIT faculty members Esther Duflo, the Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Poverty Alleviation and Development Economics, and Abhijit Banerjee, the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics. Duflo and Banerjee’s research provided an entirely new approach to designing, implementing, and evaluating antipoverty initiatives throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The MicroMasters in DEDP program provided the framework Wesley had sought nearly 20 years ago as an undergraduate student. He learned about novel economic incentives that stymied corruption and promoted education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It wasn't just an academic experience for me,” Wesley says. “The classes gave me the tools and the frameworks to analyze my own personal experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wesley initially stumbled with the quantitative coursework. Having a demanding career, taking extension courses at another university, and being several years removed from college calculus courses took a toll on him. He had to retake some classes, especially&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+14.310x/"&gt;Data Analysis for Social Scientists&lt;/a&gt;, several times before he could pass the proctored exam. His persistence paid off. Wesley earned his MicroMasters in DEDP credential in June 2023 and was also admitted into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/academic-programs/masters-programs/masters-data-economics-and-design-policy-dedp"&gt;MIT DEDP master’s program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The class twisted my brain in so many different ways,” Wesley says. “The fourth time taking Data Analysis, I began to understand it. I appreciate that MIT did not care that I did poorly on my first try. They cared that over time I understood the material.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The program’s rigorous mathematics and statistics classes sparked in Wesley a passion for artificial intelligence, especially machine learning and natural language processing. Both provide more powerful ways to extract and interpret data, and Wesley has a special interest in mining qualitative sources for information. He plans to use these tools to compare national development plans over time and among different countries to determine if policymakers are recycling the same words and goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once Wesley earns his master’s degree, he plans to return to Liberia and focus on international development. In the future, he hopes to lead a data-focused organization committed to improving the lives of people in Liberia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Thanks to MIT, I have the knowledge and tools to tackle real-world challenges that traditional economic models often overlook,” Wesley says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Migrants have become a flashpoint in global politics. But new research by an MIT political scientist, focused on West Germany and Poland after World War II, shows that in the long term, those countries developed stronger states, more prosperous economies, and more entrepreneurship after receiving a large influx of immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings come from a close examination, at the local level over many decades, of&amp;nbsp;the communities receiving migrants as millions of people relocated westward when Europe’s postwar borders were redrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found that places experiencing large-scale displacement [immigration] wound up accumulating state capacity, versus places that did not,” says Volha Charnysh, the Ford Career Development Associate Professor in MIT’s Department of Political Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charnysh’s new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/uprooted/CE6B3075998AD5B1FBC44F2A3C494C6A" target="_blank"&gt;Uprooted: How Post-WWII Population Transfers Remade Europe&lt;/a&gt;,” published by Cambridge University Press, challenges the notion that migrants have a negative impact on receiving communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time frame of the analysis is important. Much discussion about refugees involves the short-term strains they place on institutions or the backlash they provoke in local communities. Charnysh’s research does reveal tensions in the postwar communities that received large numbers of refugees. But her work, distinctively, also quantifies long-run outcomes, producing a different overall picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Charnysh writes in the book, “Counterintuitively, mass displacement ended up strengthening the state and improving economic performance in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extracting data from history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World War II wrought a colossal amount of death, destruction, and suffering, including the Holocaust, the genocide of about 6 million European Jews. The ensuing peace settlement among the Allied Powers led to large-scale population transfers. Poland saw its borders moved about 125 miles west; it was granted formerly German territory while ceding eastern territory to the Soviet Union. Its new region became 80 percent filled by new migrants,&amp;nbsp;including Poles displaced from the east and voluntary migrants from other parts of the country and from abroad. West Germany received an influx of 12.5 million Germans displaced from Poland and other parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the impact of these population transfers, Charnysh used historical records to create four original quantitative datasets at the municipal and county level, while also examining archival documents, memoirs, and newspapers to better understand the texture of the time. The assignment of refugees to specific communities within Poland and West Germany amounted to&amp;nbsp;a kind of historical natural experiment, allowing her to compare how&amp;nbsp;the size and regional composition of the migrant population&amp;nbsp;affected otherwise similar areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, studying forced displacement — as opposed to the movement of a self-selected group of immigrants — meant Charnysh could rigorously examine the scaled-up effects of mass migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been an opportunity to study in a more robust way the consequences of displacement,” Charnysh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Holocaust, followed by the redrawing of borders, expulsions, and mass relocations,&amp;nbsp;appeared to increase the homogeneity of the populations within them: In 1931 Poland consisted of about one-third ethnic minorities, whereas after the war it became almost ethnically uniform. But one insight of Charnysh’s research is that shared ethnic or national identification does not guarantee social acceptance for migrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you just rearrange ethnically homogenous populations, new cleavages emerge,” Charnysh says. “People will not necessarily see others as being the same. Those who are displaced have suffered together, have a particular status in their new place, and realize their commonalities. For the native population, migrants’ arrival increased competition for jobs, housing, and state resources, so shared identities likewise emerged, and this ethnic homogeneity didn’t automatically translate into more harmonious relations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, West Germany and Poland did assimilate these groups of immgrants into their countries. In both places, state capacity grew in the decades after the war, with the countries becoming better able to administer resources for their populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The very problem, that migration and diversity can create conflict, can also create the demand for more state presence and, in cases where states are willing and able to step in,&amp;nbsp;allow for the accumulation of greater state capacity over time,” Charnysh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State investment in migrant-receiving localities paid off.&amp;nbsp;By the 1980s in West Germany, areas with greater postwar migration had higher levels of education, with more business enterprises being founded. That economic pattern emerged in Poland after it switched to a market economy in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needed: Property rights and liberties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In “Uprooted,” Charnysh also discusses the conditions in which the example of West Germany and Poland may apply to other countries. For one thing, the phenomenon of migrants bolstering the economy is likeliest to occur where states offer what the scholars Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson of MIT and James Robinson of the University of Chicago have called “inclusive institutions,” such as property rights, additional liberties, and a commitment to the rule of law. Poland, while increasing its state capacity during the Cold War, did not realize the economic benefits of migration until the Cold War ended and it changed to a more democratic government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Charnysh observes, West Germany and Poland were granting citizenship to the migrants they received, making it easier for those migrants to assimilate and make demands on the state. “My complete account probably applies best to cases where migrants receive full citizenship rights,” she acknowledges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Uprooted” has earned praise from leading scholars. David Stasavage, dean for the social sciences and a professor of politics at New York University, has called the book a “pathbreaking study” that “upends what we thought we knew about the interaction between social cohesion and state capacity.” Charnysh’s research, he adds, “shows convincingly that areas with more diverse populations after the transfers saw greater improvements in state capacity and economic performance. This is a major addition to scholarship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today there may be about 100 million displaced people around the world, including perhaps 14 million Ukrainians uprooted by war. Absorbing refugees may always be a matter of political contention. But as “Uprooted” shows, countries may realize benefits from it if they take a long-term perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When states treat refugees as temporary, they don’t provide opportunities for them to contribute and assimilate,” Charnysh says. “It’s not that I don’t think cultural differences matter to people, but it’s not as big a factor as state policies.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>MIT Center for International Studies</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MIT Global Seed Funds (GSF) program fosters global research collaborations with MIT faculty and their peers abroad — creating partnerships that tackle complex global issues, from climate change to health-care challenges and beyond.&amp;nbsp;Administered by the MIT Center for International Studies (CIS), the GSF program has awarded more than $26 million to over 1,200 faculty research projects since its inception in 2008.&amp;nbsp;Through its unique funding structure — comprising a general fund for unrestricted geographical use and several specific funds within individual countries, regions, and universities — GSF supports a wide range of projects. The current call for proposals from MIT faculty and researchers with principal investigator status is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/faculty-funds/apply-funding"&gt;&lt;em&gt;open until Dec. 10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CIS recently sat down with faculty recipients &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/josephine-v-carstensen/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Josephine Carstensen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://paocweb.mit.edu/people/davidmcg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;David McGee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to discuss the value and impact GSF added to their research. Carstensen, the Gilbert W. Winslow Career Development Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering,&amp;nbsp;generates computational designs for large-scale structures with the intent of designing novel low-carbon solutions.&amp;nbsp;McGee, the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS),&amp;nbsp;reconstructs the patterns, pace, and magnitudes of past hydro-climate changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How did the Global Seed Funds program connect you with global partnerships related to your research?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carstensen&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the projects my lab is working on is to unlock the potential of complex cast-glass structures. Through our GSF partnership with researchers at TUDelft (Netherlands), my group was able to leverage our expertise in generative design algorithms alongside the TUDelft team, who are experts in the physical casting and fabrication of glass structures. Our initial connection to TUDelft was actually through one of my graduate students who was at a conference and met TUDelft researchers. He was inspired by their work and felt there could be synergy between our labs. The question then became: How do we connect with TUDelft? And that was what led us to the Global Seed Funds program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McGee&lt;/strong&gt;: Our research is based in fieldwork conducted in partnership with experts who have a rich understanding of local environments. These locations range from lake basins in Chile and Argentina to caves in northern Mexico, Vietnam, and Madagascar.&amp;nbsp;GSF has been invaluable for helping foster partnerships with collaborators and universities in these different locations, enabling the pilot work and relationship-building necessary to establish longer-term, externally funded projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Tell us more about your&amp;nbsp;GSF-funded work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carstensen&lt;/strong&gt;: In my research group at MIT, we live mainly in a computational regime, and we do very little proof-of-concept testing. To that point, we do not even have the facilities nor experience to physically build large-scale structures, or even specialized structures. GSF has enabled us to connect with the researchers at TUDelft who do much more experimental testing than we do. Being able to work with the experts at TUDelft within their physical realm provided valuable insights into their way of approaching problems. And, likewise, the researchers at TUDelft benefited from our expertise. It has been fruitful in ways we couldn’t have imagined within our lab at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McGee&lt;/strong&gt;: The collaborative work supported by the&amp;nbsp;GSF has focused on reconstructing how past climate changes impacted rainfall patterns around the world, using natural archives like lake sediments and cave formations. One particularly successful project has been our work in caves in northeastern Mexico, which has been conducted in partnership with researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and a local caving group. This project has involved several MIT undergraduate and graduate students, sponsored a research symposium in Mexico City, and helped us obtain funding from the National Science Foundation for a longer-term project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;You both mentioned the involvement of your graduate students. How exactly has the GSF augmented the research experience of your students?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carstensen&lt;/strong&gt;: The collaboration has especially benefited the graduate students from both the MIT and TUDelft teams. The opportunity presented through this project to engage in research at an international peer institution has been extremely beneficial for their academic growth and maturity. It has facilitated training in new and complementary technical areas that they would not have had otherwise and allowed them to engage with leading world experts. An example of this aspect of the project's success is that the collaboration has inspired one of my graduate students to actively pursue postdoc opportunities in Europe (including at TU Delft) after his graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McGee&lt;/strong&gt;: MIT students have traveled to caves in northeastern Mexico and to lake basins in northern Chile to conduct fieldwork and build connections with local collaborators. Samples enabled by&amp;nbsp;GSF-supported projects became the focus of two graduate students’ PhD theses, two EAPS undergraduate senior theses, and multiple UROP [Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program] projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Were there any unexpected benefits to the work funded by&amp;nbsp;GSF?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carstensen&lt;/strong&gt;: The success of this project would not have been possible without this specific international collaboration. Both the Delft and MIT teams bring highly different essential expertise that has been necessary for the successful project outcome. It allowed both the Delft and MIT teams to gain an in-depth understanding of the expertise areas and resources of the other collaborators. Both teams have been deeply inspired. This partnership has fueled conversations about potential future projects and provided multiple outcomes, including a plan to publish two journal papers on the project outcome. The first invited publication is being finalized now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;McGee&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;GSF’s focus on reciprocal exchange has enabled external collaborators to spend time at MIT, sharing their work and exchanging ideas. Other funding is often focused on sending MIT researchers and students out, but&amp;nbsp;GSF has helped us bring collaborators here, making the relationship more equal. A&amp;nbsp;GSF-supported visit by Argentinian researchers last year made it possible for them to interact not just with my group, but with students and faculty across EAPS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;James Wesley “Jim” Harris PhD ’67, professor emeritus of Spanish and linguistics, passed away on Nov. 10. He was 92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Harris attended the University of Georgia, the Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. He later earned a master’s degree in linguistics from Louisiana State University and a PhD in linguistics from MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Harris joined the MIT faculty as an assistant professor in 1967, where he remained until his retirement in 1996. During his tenure, he served as head of what was then called the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I met Jim when I came to MIT in 1977 as department head of the neonatal Department of Linguistics and Philosophy,” says Samuel Jay Keyser, MIT professor emeritus of linguistics. “Throughout his career in the department, he never relinquished his connection to the unit that first employed him at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In his early days at MIT, when French, German, and Russian dominated as elite “languages of science and world literature,” Harris championed, over some opposition, the introduction of Spanish language and literature courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He later oversaw the inclusion of Japanese and Chinese courses as language offerings at MIT. He promoted undergraduate courses in linguistics, leading to a full undergraduate degree program and later broadening the focus of the prestigious PhD program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His research in linguistics centered on theoretical phonology and morphology. His books, presentations at professional meetings, and articles in peer-reviewed journals were among the most discussed — in both positive and negative assessments, as he noted — by prominent scholars in the field. The ability to teach complex technical material comfortably in Spanish, plus the status of an MIT professorship, resulted in invitations to teach at universities across Spain and Latin America. He was also highly valued as a member of the editorial boards of several professional journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I remember Jim most of all for being the consummate scholar,” Keyser says. “His articles were models of argumentation. They were assembled with all the precision of an Inca wall and all the beauty of a Faberge Egg.&amp;nbsp;You couldn’t slip a credit card through any of its arguments, they were so superbly sculpted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Having achieved national recognition as an English-Spanish bilingual teacher and teacher-trainer, Harris was engaged as a writer at the Modern Language Materials Development Center in New York. Later, he co-authored, with Guillermo Segreda, a series of popular college-level Spanish textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Harris belonged to Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle’s first generation of graduate students,” says MIT linguist Michael John Kenstowicz. “Together they overturned the distributionalist model of the structuralists in favor of ordered generative rules.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After retiring from MIT, he remained internationally recognized as a highly influential figure in the area of Romance linguistics, and “el decano” (“the dean”) of Spanish phonology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Harris was married to Florence Warshawsky Harris for 50 years until her passing in 2020. In 2011, in celebration of the program’s 50th anniversary, they partnered to prepare and publish a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://ling50.mit.edu/harris-development"&gt;detailed history of the linguistics program’s origins&lt;/a&gt;. Warshawsky Harris, formerly an MIT graduate student, also edited Chomsky and Halle’s influential&amp;nbsp;"The Sound Pattern of English" and numerous other important linguistic texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Harris’ scholarship was widely recognized in a diverse group of scholarly articles and textbooks he authored, co-authored, edited, and published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Harris was born outside Atlanta, Georgia, in 1932.&amp;nbsp;During the Korean War, he performed his military service as the clarinet and saxophone instructor at the U.S. Naval School of Music in Washington. After his discharge, he directed the band at the Charlotte Hall School in Maryland, where he also taught Spanish, French, and Latin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Harris is survived by ​​his daughter, Lynn Corinne Harris, his son-in-law, Rabbi David Adelson, and his grandchildren, Bee Adelson and Sam Harris.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Catherine Wolfram: High-energy scholar</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the mid 2000s, Catherine Wolfram PhD ’96 reached what she calls “an inflection point” in her career. After about a decade of studying U.S. electricity markets, she had come to recognize that “you couldn’t study the energy industries without thinking about climate mitigation,” as she puts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Wolfram understood that the trajectory of energy use in the developing world was a massively important part of the climate picture. To get a comprehensive grasp on global dynamics, she says, “I realized I needed to start thinking about the rest of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accomplished scholar and policy expert, Wolfram has been on the faculty at Harvard University, the University of California at Berkeley — and now MIT, where she is the William Barton Rogers Professor in Energy. She has also served as deputy assistant secretary for climate and energy economics at the U.S. Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even leading experts want to keep learning. So, when she hit that inflection point, Wolfram started carving out a new phase of her research career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things I love about being an academic is, I could just decide to do that,” Wolfram says. “I didn’t need to check with a boss. I could just pivot my career to being more focused to thinking about energy in the developing world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, Wolfram has published a wide array of original studies about energy consumption in the developing world. From Kenya to Mexico to South Asia, she has shed light on the dynamics of economics growth and energy consumption — while spending some of that time serving the government too. Last year, Wolfram joined the faculty of the MIT Sloan School of Management, where her work bolsters the Institute’s growing effort to combat climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying at MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfram largely grew up in Minnesota, where her father was a legal scholar, although he moved to Cornell University around the time she started high school. As an undergraduate, she majored in economics at Harvard University, and after graduation she worked first for a consultant, then for the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, the agency regulating energy rates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latter job, Wolfram kept noticing that people were often citing the research of an MIT scholar named Paul Joskow (who is now the Elizabeth and James Killian Professor of Economics Emeritus in MIT’s Department of Economics) and Richard Schmalensee (a former dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management and now the Howard W. Johnson Professor of Management Emeritus). Seeing how consequential economics research could be for policymaking, Wolfram decided to get a PhD in the field and was accepted into MIT’s doctoral program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went into graduate school with an unusually specific view of what I wanted to do,” Wolfram says. “I wanted to work with Paul Joskow and Dick Schmalensee on electricity markets, and that’s how I wound up here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Wolfram also ended up working extensively with Nancy Rose, the Charles P. Kindleberger Professor of Applied Economics and a former head of the Department of Economics, who helped oversee Wolfram’s thesis; Rose has extensively studied market regulation as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfram’s dissertation research largely focused on price-setting behavior in the U.K.’s newly deregulated electricity markets, which, it turned out, applied handily to the U.S., where a similar process was taking place. “I was fortunate because this was around the time California was thinking about restructuring, as it was known,” Wolfram says. She spent four years on the faculty at Harvard, then moved to UC Berkeley. Wolfram’s studies have shown that deregulation has had some medium-term benefits, for instance in making power plants operate more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning on the AC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By around 2010, though, Wolfram began shifting her scholarly focus in earnest, conducting innovative studies about energy in the developing world. One strand of her research has centered on Kenya, to better understand how more energy access for people without electricity might fit into growth in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, Wolfram’s perhaps surprising conclusion is that electrification itself is not a magic ticket to prosperity; people without electricity are more eager to adopt it when they have a practical economic need for it. Meanwhile, they have other essential needs that are not necessarily being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The 800 million people in the world who don’t have electricity also don’t have access to good health care or running water,” Wolfram says. “Giving them better housing infrastructure is important, and harder to tackle. It’s not clear that bringing people electricity alone is the single most useful thing from a development perspective. Although electricity is a super-important component of modern living.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfram has even delved into topics such as air conditioner use in the developing world — an important driver of energy use. As her research shows, many countries, with a combined population far bigger than the U.S., are among the fastest-growing adopters of air conditioners and have an even greater need for them, based on their climates. Adoption of air conditioning within those countries also is characterized by marked economic inequality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From early 2021 until late 2022, Wolfram also served in the administration of President Joe Biden, where her work also centered on global energy issues. Among other things, Wolfram was part of the team working out a price-cap policy for Russian oil exports, a concept that she thinks could be applied to many other products globally. Although, she notes, working with countries heavily dependent on exporting energy materials will always require careful engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be mindful of that dependence and importance as we go through this massive effort to decarbonize the energy sector and shift it to a whole new paradigm,” Wolfram says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At MIT again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she notes, the world does need a whole new energy paradigm, and fast. Her arrival at MIT overlaps with the emergence of a new Institute-wide effort, the Climate Project at MIT, that aims to accelerate and scale climate solutions and good climate policy, including through the new Climate Policy Center at MIT Sloan. That kind of effort, Wolfram says, matters to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s part of why I’ve come to MIT,” Wolfram says. “Technology will be one part of the climate solution, but I do think an innovative mindset, how can we think about doing things better, can be productively applied to climate policy.” On being at MIT, she adds: “It’s great, it’s awesome. One of the things that pleasantly surprised me is how tight-knit and friendly the MIT faculty all are, and how many interactions I’ve had with people from other departments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfram has also been enjoying her teaching at MIT, and will be offering a large class in spring 2025, 15.016 (Climate and Energy in the Global Economy), that she debuted this past academic year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s super fun to have students from around the world, who have personal stories and knowledge of energy systems in their countries and can contribute to our discussions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to tackling climate change, many things seem daunting. But there is still a world of knowledge to be acquired while we try to keep the planet from overheating, and Wolfram has a can-do attitude about learning more and applying those lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve made a lot of progress,” Wolfram says. “But we still have a lot more to do.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[New research shows that a grasp of grammar helps even very young children figure out when they must acquire new words.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As young children, how do we build our vocabulary? Even by age 1, many infants seem to think that if they hear a new word, it means something different from the words they already know. But why they think so has remained subject to inquiry among scholars for the last 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study carried out at the MIT Language Acquisition Lab offers a novel insight into the matter: Sentences contain&amp;nbsp;subtle hints in their grammar that tell young children about the meaning of new words. The finding, based on experiments with 2-year-olds, suggests that even very young kids are capable of absorbing grammatical cues from language and leveraging that information to acquire new words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even at a surprisingly young age, kids have sophisticated knowledge of the grammar of sentences and can use that to learn the meanings of new words,” says Athulya Aravind, an associate professor of linguistics at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new insight stands in contrast to a prior explanation for how children build vocabulary: that they rely on the concept of “mutual exclusivity,” meaning they treat each new word as corresponding to a new object or category. Instead, the new research shows how extensively children respond directly to grammatical information when interpreting words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For us it’s very exciting because it’s a very simple idea that explains so much about how children understand language,” says Gabor Brody, a postdoc at Brown University, who is the first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper is titled, “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09567976241287732" target="_blank"&gt;Why Do Children Think Words Are Mutually Exclusive?&lt;/a&gt;” It is published in advance online form in &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;. The authors are Brody; Roman Feiman, the Thomas J. and Alice M. Tisch Assistant Professor of Cognitive and Psychological Sciences and Linguistics at Brown; and Aravind, the Alfred Henry and&amp;nbsp;Jean Morrison Hayes Career Development Associate Professor in MIT’s Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many scholars have thought that young children, when learning new words, have an innate bias toward mutual exclusivity, which could explain how children learn some of their new words. However, the concept of mutual exclusivity has never been airtight: Words like “bat” refer to multiple kinds of objects, while any object can be described using countlessly many words. For instance a rabbit can be called not only a “rabbit” or a “bunny,” but also an “animal,” or a “beauty,” and in some contexts even a “delicacy.” Despite this lack of perfect one-to-one mapping between words and objects, mutual exclusivity has still been posited as a strong tendency in children’s word learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Aravind, Brody, and Fieman propose is that children have no such tendency, and instead rely on so-called “focus” signals to decide what a new word means. Linguists use the term “focus” to refer to the way we emphasize or stress certain words to signal some kind of contrast. Depending on what is focused, the same sentence can have different implications. “Carlos&amp;nbsp;gave Lewis a &lt;em&gt;Ferrari&lt;/em&gt;” implies contrast with other possible cars — he could have given Lewis a Mercedes. But “Carlos gave &lt;em&gt;Lewis&lt;/em&gt; a Ferrari” implies contrast with other people — he could have given Alexandra a Ferrari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ experiments manipulated focus in three experiments with a total of 106 children. The participants watched videos of a cartoon fox who asked them to point to different objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first experiment established how focus influences kids’ choice between two objects when they hear a label, like “toy,” that could, in principle, correspond to either of the two. After giving a name to one of the two objects (“Look, I am pointing to the blicket”), the fox told the child, “Now you point to the toy!” Children were divided into two groups. One group heard “toy” without emphasis, while the other heard it with emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first version, “blicket” and “toy” plausibly refer to the same object. But in the second version, the added focus, through intonation, implies that “toy” contrasts with the previously discussed “blicket.” Without focus, only 24 percent of the respondents thought the words were mutually exclusive, whereas with the focus created by emphasizing “toy,” 89 percent of participants thought “blicket” and “toy” referred to different objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second and third experiments showed that focus is not just key when it comes to words like “toy,” but it also affects the interpretation of new words children have never encountered before, like “wug” or “dax.” If a new word was said without focus, children thought the word meant the previously named object 71 percent of the time. But when hearing the new word spoken with focus, they thought it must refer to a new object 87 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though they know nothing about this new word, when it was focused, that still told them something: Focus communicated to children the presence of a contrasting alternative, and they correspondingly understood the noun to refer to an object that had not previously been labeled,” Aravind explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She adds: “The particular claim we’re making is that there is no inherent bias in children toward mutual exclusivity. The only reason we make the corresponding inference is because focus tells you that the word means something different from another word. When focus goes away, children don’t draw those exclusivity inferences any more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the full set of experiments sheds new light on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Earlier explanations of mutual exclusivity introduced a whole new problem,” Feiman says. “If kids assume words are mutually exclusive, how do they learn words that are not? After all, you can call the same animal either a rabbit or a bunny, and kids have to learn both of those at some point. Our finding explains why this isn't actually a problem. Kids won’t think the new word is mutually exclusive with the old word by default, unless adults tell them that it is — all adults have to do if the new word is not mutually exclusive is just say it without focusing it, and they’ll naturally do that if they're thinking about it as compatible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning language from language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment, the researchers note, is the result of interdisciplinary research bridging psychology and linguistics — in this case, mobilizing the linguistics concept of focus to address an issue of interest in both fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are hopeful this will be a paper that shows that small, simple theories have a place in psychology,” Brody says. “It is a very small theory, not a huge model of the mind, but it completely flips the switch on some phenomena we thought we understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the new hypothesis is correct, the researchers may have developed a more robust explanation about how children correctly apply new words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An influential idea in language development is that children can use their existing knowledge of language to learn more language,” Aravind says. “We’re in a sense building on that idea, and saying that even in the simplest cases, aspects of language that children already know, in this case an understanding of focus, help them grasp the meanings of unknown words.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholars acknowledge that more studies could further advance our knowledge about the issue. Future research, they note in the paper, could reexamine prior studies about mutual exclusivity, record and study naturalistic interactions between parents and children to see how focus is used, and examine the issue in other languages, especially those marking focus in alternate ways, such as word order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was supported, in part, by a Jacobs Foundation Fellowship awarded to Feiman.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anoushka Bose ’20 spent the summer of 2018 as an MIT Washington program intern, applying her nuclear physics education to arms control research with a D.C. nuclear policy think tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s crazy how much three months can transform people,” says Bose, now an attorney at the Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Suddenly, I was learning far more than I had expected about treaties, nuclear arms control, and foreign relations,” adds Bose. “But once I was hooked, I couldn’t be stopped as that summer sparked a much broader interest in diplomacy and set me on a different path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bose is one of hundreds of MIT undergraduates whose academic and career trajectories were influenced by their time in the nation’s capital as part of the internship program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leah Nichols ’00 is a former D.C. intern, and now executive director of George Mason University’s Institute for a Sustainable Earth. In 1998, Nichols worked in the office of U.S. Senator Max Baucus, D-Mont., developing options for protecting open space on private land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really started to see how science and policy needed to interact in order to solve environmental challenges,” she says. “I’ve actually been working at that interface between science and policy ever since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marking its 30th anniversary this year, the MIT Washington Summer Internship Program has shaped the lives of alumni, and expanded MIT’s capital in the capital city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bose believes the MIT Washington summer internship is more vital than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This program helps steer more technical expertise, analytical thinking, and classic MIT innovation into policy spaces to make them better-informed and better equipped to solve challenges,” she says. With so much at stake, she suggests, it is increasingly important “to invest in bringing the MIT mindset of extreme competence as well as resilience to D.C.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT missionaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three decades, students across MIT — whether studying aeronautics or nuclear engineering, management or mathematics, chemistry or computer science — have competed for and won an MIT Washington summer internship. Many describe it as a springboard into high-impact positions in politics, public policy, and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program was launched in 1994 by Charles Stewart III, the Kenan Sahin (1963) Distinguished Professor of Political Science, who still serves as the director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea 30 years ago was to make this a bit of a missionary program, where we demonstrate to Washington the utility of having MIT students around for things they’re doing,” says Stewart. “MIT’s reputation benefits because our students are unpretentious, down-to-earth, interested in how the world actually works, and dedicated to fixing things that are broken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlines of the program have remained much the same: A cohort of 15 to 20 students is selected from a pool of fall applicants. With the help of MIT’s Washington office, the students are matched with potential supervisors in search of technical and scientific talent. They travel in the spring to meet potential supervisors and receive a stipend and housing for the summer. In the fall, students take a course that Stewart describes as an “Oxbridge-type tutorial, where they contextualize their experiences and reflect on the political context of the place where they worked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stewart remains as enthusiastic about the internship program as when he started and has notions for building on its foundations. His wish list includes running the program at other times of the year, and for longer durations. “Six months would really change and deepen the experience,” he says. He envisions a real-time tutorial while the students are in Washington. And he would like to draw more students from the data science world. “Part of the goal of this program is to hook non-obvious people into knowledge of the public policy realm,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prized in Washington&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT Vice Provost Philip Khoury, who helped get the program off the ground, praised Stewart’s vision for developing the initial idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Charles understood why science- and technology-oriented students would be great beneficiaries of an experience in Washington and had something to contribute that other internship program students would not be able to do because of their prowess, their prodigious abilities in the technology-engineering-science world,” says Khoury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khoury adds that the program has benefited both the host organizations and the students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Members of Congress and senior staff who were developing policies prized MIT students, because they were powerful thinkers and workaholics, and students in the program learned that they really mattered to adults in Washington, wherever they went.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Goldston, director of the MIT Washington Office, says government is “kind of desperate for people who understand science and technology.” One example: The National Institute of Standards and Technology has launched an artificial intelligence safety division that is “almost begging for students to help conduct research and carry out the ever-expanding mission of worrying about AI issues,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holly Krambeck ’06 MST/MCP, program manager of the World Bank Data Lab, can attest to this impact. She hired her first MIT summer intern, Chae Won Lee, in 2013, to analyze road crash data from the Philippines. “Her findings were so striking, we invited her to join the team on a mission to present her work to the government,” says Krambeck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent interns have helped the World Bank demonstrate effective, low-cost, transit-fare collection systems; identify houses eligible for hurricane protection retrofits under World Bank loans; and analyze heatwave patterns in the Philippines to inform a lending program for mitigation measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every year, I’ve been so impressed by the maturity, energy, willingness to learn new skills, and curiosity of the MIT students,” says Krambeck. “At the end of each summer, we ask students to present their projects to World Bank staff, who are invariably amazed to learn that these are undergraduates and not PhD candidates!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It absolutely changed my career pathway,” says Samuel Rodarte Jr. ’13, a 2011 program alumnus who interned at the MIT Washington Office, where he tracked congressional hearings related to research at the Institute. Today, he serves as a legislative assistant to Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer. An aerospace engineering and Latin American studies double major, Rodarte says the opportunity to experience policymaking from the inside came “at just the right time, when I was trying to figure out what I really wanted to do post-MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miranda Priebe ’03 is director of the Center for Analysis of U.S. Grand Strategy for the Rand Corp. She briefs groups within the Pentagon, the U.S. Department of State, and the National Security Council, among others. “My job is to ask the big question: Does the United States have the right approach in the world in terms of advancing our interests with our capabilities and resources?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priebe was a physics major with an evolving interest in political science when she arrived in Washington in 2001 to work in the office of Senator Carl Levin, D-Mich., the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “I was working really hard at MIT, but just hadn’t found my passion until I did this internship,” she says. “Once I came to D.C. I saw all the places I could fit in using my analytical skills — there were a million things I wanted to do — and the internship convinced me that this was the right kind of work for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her internship in 2022, Anushree Chaudhuri ’24, urban studies and planning and economics major, worked in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Building Technologies Office, where she hoped to experience day-to-day life in a federal agency — with an eye toward a career in high-level policymaking. She developed a web app to help local governments determine which census tracts qualified for environmental justice funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was pleasantly surprised to see that even as a lower-level civil servant you can make change if you know how to work within the system.” Chaudhuri is now a Marshall Scholar, pursuing a PhD at the University of Oxford on the socioeconomic impacts of energy infrastructure. “I’m pretty sure I want to work in the policy space long term,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Victoria Moura | J-PAL North America</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;J-PAL North America recently selected government partners for the 2024-25&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lever"&gt;Leveraging Evaluation and Evidence for Equitable Recovery&lt;/a&gt; (LEVER) Evaluation Incubator cohort. Selected collaborators will receive funding and technical assistance to develop or launch a randomized evaluation for one of their programs. These collaborations represent jurisdictions across the United States and demonstrate the growing enthusiasm for evidence-based policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Launched in 2023, LEVER is a joint venture between &lt;a href="http://povertyactionlab.org/na"&gt;J-PAL North America&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://results4america.org/"&gt;Results for America.&lt;/a&gt; Through the Evaluation Incubator,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lever/training-sprint"&gt;trainings&lt;/a&gt;, and other program offerings, LEVER seeks to address the barriers many state and local governments face around finding and generating evidence to inform program design. LEVER offers government leaders the opportunity to learn&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://results4america.org/tools/evaluation-policy-guide/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Eval+Policy+Guide+24"&gt;best practices for policy evaluations&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://results4america.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Results-for-America_Evaluation-Policy-Practices-Checklist.pdf"&gt;how to integrate evidence into decision-making&lt;/a&gt;. Since the program’s inception, more than 80 government jurisdictions have participated in LEVER offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;J-PAL North America’s Evaluation Incubator helps collaborators turn policy-relevant research questions into well-designed randomized evaluations, generating rigorous evidence to inform pressing programmatic and policy decisions. The program also aims to build a culture of evidence use and give government partners the tools to continue generating and utilizing evidence in their day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to funding and technical assistance, the selected state and local government collaborators will be connected with researchers from J-PAL’s network to help advance their evaluation ideas. Evaluation support will also be centered on community-engaged research practices, which emphasize collaborating with and learning from the groups most affected by the program being evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation Incubator selected projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.piercecountywa.gov/hs"&gt;Pierce County Human Services&lt;/a&gt; (PCHS) in the state of Washington will evaluate two programs as part of the Evaluation Incubator. The first will examine how extending stays in a fentanyl detox program affects the successful completion of inpatient treatment and hospital utilization for individuals. “PCHS is interested in evaluating longer fentanyl detox stays to inform our funding decisions, streamline our resource utilization, and encourage additional financial commitments to address the unmet needs of individuals dealing with opioid use disorder,” says Trish Crocker, grant coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The second PCHS program will evaluate the impact of providing medication and outreach services via a mobile distribution unit to individuals with opioid use disorders on program take-up and substance usage. Margo Burnison, a behavioral health manager with PCHS, says that the team is “thrilled to be partnering with J-PAL North America to dive deep into the data to inform our elected leaders on the best way to utilize available resources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The City of Los Angeles&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ydd.lacity.gov/research"&gt;Youth Development Department&lt;/a&gt; (YDD) seeks to evaluate a research-informed program:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://socialjustice.usc.edu/student-engagement-exploration-and-development-seeds/"&gt;Student Engagement, Exploration, and Development in STEM&lt;/a&gt; (SEEDS). This intergenerational STEM mentorship program supports underrepresented middle school and college students in STEM by providing culturally responsive mentorship. The program seeks to foster these students’ STEM identity and degree attainment in higher education. YDD has been working with researchers at the University of Southern California to measure the SEEDS program’s impact, but is interested in developing a randomized evaluation to generate further evidence. Darnell Cole, professor and co-director of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://socialjustice.usc.edu/"&gt;Research Center for Education, Identity and Social Justice&lt;/a&gt;, shares his excitement about the collaboration with J-PAL: “We welcome the opportunity to measure the impact of the SEEDS program on our students’ educational experience. Rigorously testing the SEEDS program will help us improve support for STEM students, ultimately enhancing their persistence and success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Fort Wayne Police Department’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.fwpd.org/divisions/h-a-r-t"&gt;Hope and Recovery Team&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana will evaluate the impact of two programs that connect social workers with people who have experienced an overdose, or who have a mental health illness, to treatment and resources. “We believe we are on the right track in the work we are doing with the crisis intervention social worker and the recovery coach, but having an outside evaluation of both programs would be extremely helpful in understanding whether and what aspects of these programs are most effective,” says Police Captain Kevin Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/"&gt;County of San Diego&lt;/a&gt;’s Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics, and Planning &amp;amp; Development Services will engage with J-PAL staff to explore evaluation opportunities for two programs that are a part of the county’s Climate Action Plan. The Equity-Driven Tree Planting Program seeks to increase tree canopy coverage, and the Climate Smart Land Stewardship Program will encourage climate-smart agricultural practices. Ricardo Basurto-Davila, chief evaluation officer, says that “the county is dedicated to evidence-based policymaking and taking decisive action against climate change. The work with J-PAL will support us in combining these commitments to maximize the effectiveness in decreasing emissions through these programs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;J-PAL North America looks forward to working with the selected collaborators in the coming months to learn more about these promising programs, clarify our partner’s evidence goals, and design randomized evaluations to measure their impact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Stopping the bomb</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Political science PhD student Kunal Singh identifies a suite of strategies states use to prevent other nations from developing nuclear weapons.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 09:55:00 -0500</pubDate>

        <dc:creator>Leda Zimmerman | Department of Political Science</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“The question behind my doctoral research is simple,” says Kunal Singh, an MIT political science graduate student in his final year of studies. “When one country learns that another country is trying to make a nuclear weapon, what options does it have to stop the other country from achieving that goal?” While the query may be straightforward, answers are anything but, especially at a moment when some nations appear increasingly tempted by the nuclear option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Middle East to India and Pakistan, and from the Korean peninsula to Taiwan, Singh has been developing a typology of counterproliferation strategies based on historical cases and to some degree on emergent events. His aim is to clarify what states can do “to stop the bomb before it is made.” Singh’s interviews with top security officials and military personnel involved in designing and executing these strategies have illuminated tense episodes in the past 75 years or so when states have jockeyed to enter the elite atomic club. His insights might upend some of the binary thinking that dominates the field of nuclear security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, I’d like my work to help decision-makers predict counterproliferation strategy, and draw lessons from it on how to shield their own citizens and economies from the impact of these strategies,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of nonproliferation tactics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 7, 2023, Singh awoke to air raid sirens in Jerusalem, where he was conducting interviews, and discovered Israel was under attack. He was airlifted to safety back to the United States, having borne witness to the start of a regional war that “now has become relevant to my research,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his hasty departure, Singh was investigating two singular episodes where military force was deployed to advance nonproliferation goals: Israel’s airstrikes against nuclear reactors in 1981 in Iraq, and in 2007 in Syria. To date, these have been the only major attacks on nuclear facilities outside of an active war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I spoke with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who ordered the strike in Syria, and with the commander of the Israeli Air Force who planned the Iraq airstrike, as well as with other members of the security bureaucracy,” says Singh. “Israel feels a large degree of threat because it is a very small country surrounded by hostile powers, so it takes a military route to stop another state from acquiring nuclear weapons,” says Singh. But, he notes, “most of the states which are not in this predicament generally resort to diplomatic methods first, and threaten violence only as a last resort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh defines the military response by Israel as “kinetic reversion,” one of five types of counterproliferation strategies he has identified. Another is “military coercion,” where a state threatens the use of military force or uses moderate force to demonstrate its commitment to preventing the pursuit of the bomb. States can also use diplomatic and economic leverage over the proliferant to persuade it to drop its nuclear program, what Singh calls “diplomatic inhibition.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One form this strategy takes is when one country agrees to give up its program in return for the other doing the same. Another form involves “placing sanctions on a country and excluding them from the world economy, until the country rolls back its program — a strategy the U.S. has employed against Iran, North Korea, Libya, and Pakistan,” says Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India was rumored to have embraced military tactics. “I had always read about the claim that India was ready to attack the Pakistani uranium enrichment plant in Kahuta, and that planes were called off at the last minute,” Singh says. “But in interview after interview I found this was not the case, and I discovered that many written accounts of this episode had been completely blown up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another strategy, “pooled prevention,” nations can band together to apply economic, diplomatic, and military pressure on a potential proliferator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh notes that diplomatic inhibition, pooled prevention, and military coercion have succeeded, historically. “In 2003, Libya gave up its nuclear weapons program completely after the U.S. and U.K. placed sanctions on it, and many states do not even start a nuclear weapons program because they anticipate an attack or a sanction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final strategy Singh defines is “accommodation,” where one or more states decide not to take action against nuclear weapon development. The United States arrived at this strategy when China began its nuclear program — after first considering and rejecting military attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh hopes that his five kinds of strategies challenge a “binary trap” that most academics in the field fall into. “They think of counterproliferation either as military attack or no military attack, economic sanctions or no sanctions, and so they miss out on the spectrum of behaviors, and how fluid they can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From journalism to security studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singh grew up in Varanasi, a Hindu holy city in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Frequent terrorist attacks throughout India, and some inside his city’s temples, made a deep impression on him during his childhood, he says. A math and science talent, he attended the Indian Institute of Technology, majoring in metallurgical and materials engineering. After a brief stint with a management consulting firm, after college, he landed a job at a think tank, the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I moved to New Delhi, I suddenly saw a world which I didn’t know existed,” Singh recalls. “I began meeting people for an evening round of discussions and began reading voraciously: books, editorial and opinion pages in newspapers, and looking for a greater sense of purpose and meaning in my work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His widening interests led to a job as staff writer, first at &lt;em&gt;Mint,&lt;/em&gt; a business newspaper, and then to the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times,&lt;/em&gt; working on both papers’ editorial pages. “This was where most of my intellectual development happened,” says Singh. “I made social connections, and many of them grew more towards the academics in the security field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing about a nuclear security question one day, Singh reached out to an expert in the United States: Vipin Narang, the Frank Stanton Professor of Nuclear Security and Political Science at MIT. Over time, Narang helped Singh realize that the kind of questions Singh hoped to answer “lay more in the academic than in the journalistic domain,” recounts Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, he headed to MIT and began a doctoral program focused on security studies and international relations. In his dissertation, “Nipping the Atom in the Bud: Strategies of Counterproliferation and How States Choose Among Them,” Singh hopes to move beyond a classic, academic debate: that nuclear weapons are either very destabilizing, or very stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some argue that there is stability in the world because two states armed with nuclear weapons will avoid nuclear war, because they understand nobody will win a nuclear war,” explains Singh. “If this view is true, then we shouldn’t be alarmed by the proliferation of these weapons.” But “the counterargument is that there will always be an off chance someone will use these weapons, and so states should “try to use all their military and economic might to prevent another state from gaining nuclear weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, neither extreme view governs in the real world. “The main takeaway from my research is that states are obviously concerned when some other country tries to make nuclear weapons, but they are not so concerned that in order to prevent a future destabilizing event, they are ready to destabilize the world as of now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final throes of writing his thesis and preparing for life as an academic, Singh remains alert to the parlous state of affairs in the Middle East and elsewhere. “I keep following events, knowing that something may prove relevant to my research,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the tense times and the often dark implications of his subject matter, Singh has found an optimal mode of blowing off steam: a daily badminton match. He and his wife also “binge watch either a spy thrill or a murder mystery every Saturday,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world both increasingly interconnected and increasingly threatened by regional conflicts, Singh believes, “there is still much to be discovered about how the world thinks about nuclear weapons, including what the impacts of nuclear weapons use might be,” he says. “I’d like to help shine a light on those new things, and broaden our understanding of nuclear weapons and the politics of nuclear security.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Now in his seventh year at MIT, his work as an innovator will impact the Institute for years to come.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p paraid="610166423" paraeid="{4d196566-e2ac-468c-80ab-2321a9768111}{37}"&gt;Keselman and his family are refugees from the Soviet Union. To say that the United States opened its arms and took care of his family is something Keselman calls “an understatement.” Growing up, he felt both gratitude and the need to give back to the country that took in his family. Because of this, Keselman joined the U.S. Air Force after college. Originally, he thought he would spend a few years in the Air Force, earn money to attend graduate school, and leave. Instead, he found a sense of belonging in the military lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p paraid="610166423" paraeid="{4d196566-e2ac-468c-80ab-2321a9768111}{37}"&gt;Early on, Keselman was a nuclear operations officer for four years, watching over nuclear weapons in Wyoming; while it was not a glamorous job, it was a strategically important one. He then joined the intelligence community in Washington, working on special programs for space. Next, he became an acquisition and innovation generalist inside the Air Force, working his way up to the rank of colonel, working on an innovation team at the Pentagon. Meanwhile, Keselman started exploring what his nonmilitary entrepreneurial life could look like. He left active duty after 12 years, entered the reserves, and began his relationship with MIT as an MBA student at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="507190417" paraeid="{1a43bea0-058c-4add-829f-82763b93072d}{14}"&gt;At MIT Sloan, Keselman met Fiona Murray, associate dean of innovation and inclusion, who took an interest in Keselman’s experience. When the position of executive director of the Innovation Initiative (a program launched by then-President L. Rafael Reif) became available, Murray and &lt;a href="https://mitnano.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MIT.nano&lt;/a&gt; Director Vladimir Bulovic hired Keselman and became his managers and main collaborators. While he was unsure that he would be a natural inside academia, Keselman credits Murray and Bulovic with seeing that his skill set from working with the Department of Defense (DoD) and in the military could translate and be useful in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1126805665" paraeid="{1a43bea0-058c-4add-829f-82763b93072d}{183}"&gt;As a military officer, Keselman focused on process, innovation, leadership, and team building — tools he found useful in his new position. Over the next five years at MIT — a place, he admits, that was already at the forefront of innovation — he ran and created programs that augment how the Institute’s cutting-edge research is shared with the world. When the Innovation Initiative became the &lt;a href="http://innovation.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Office of Innovation&lt;/a&gt;, Keselman handed off executive duties to his deputy. Today, he oversees two programs. The first, MIx, focuses on national security innovation, defense technology, and dual-use (creating a commercial product and a capability for the government or defense). The other, Proto Ventures, is centered around venture building and translation of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1582171075" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{23}"&gt;With MIx and Proto Ventures established, it was time to build a teaching component for students interested in working for a startup that the government might want to partner with and learn from. Keselman becoming a lecturer at Sloan seemed like a clear next step. What started as a hackathon for MIT Air Force, Army, and Navy ROTC students to introduce the special operations community to those who were planning to become military officers turned into a class open to all undergrad and graduate students. Keselman co-teaches &lt;a href="https://mix.mit.edu/opportunities/engineering-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;innovation engineering for global security systems&lt;/a&gt;, a design/build class in collaboration with U.S. Special Operations Command, where students learn to build innovative solutions in response to global security problems. Students who do not plan to work for the government enroll because of their desire to work on the most interesting — and difficult — problems in the world. Enrollment in these courses sometimes changes the career trajectory of students who decide they would like to work on national security-related problems in the future. While teaching was not an initial part of his plan, the opportunity to teach has become one of his joys.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1681813811" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{136}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soundbytes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1727886703" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{142}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What project brings you the most pride?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="287711229" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{154}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keselman:&lt;/strong&gt; Proto Ventures is probably what I will look back on that will have made the most impact on MIT. I’m proud that I've continued to sustain it. Building a venture studio inside MIT is unique and is not replicated anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1638345505" paraeid="{848f9ebd-1330-48c5-8d6d-a467968ddf4a}{202}"&gt;I’m also really proud of our work with &lt;a href="https://www.nato.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.diana.nato.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Defence &lt;/a&gt;Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA). DIANA is NATO’s effort to start its own accelerator program for startups to encourage them to work on solving national security questions in their country, based on the model at MIT. We built the curriculum, and I’ve taught it to DIANA startups in places including Italy, Poland, Denmark, and Estonia. The fact that NATO recognized that we need to promote access to startups and that there is a need to create an accelerator network is amazing. When it started, MIT was probably one of the only places teaching dual-use in the country. The fact that I got to take this curriculum and build it to scale in 32 countries and hundreds of startups is really rewarding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1806168315" paraeid="{cdd748d4-ae0e-4e11-822c-c542c37781c9}{117}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;In recognition of their service to our country, MIT actively seeks to recruit and employ veterans throughout its workforce. As a reservist, how does MIT support the time you take away from the Institute to fulfill your duties?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="429449854" paraeid="{cdd748d4-ae0e-4e11-822c-c542c37781c9}{127}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keselman:&lt;/strong&gt; MIT has a long history with the military, especially back in WWII times. With that comes a deep history of supporting the military. When I came to MIT I found a welcoming community that enables me to run centers, teach, and have students work on problems brought to us by the government. The magical thing about MIT is an openness to collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="904050973" paraeid="{cdd748d4-ae0e-4e11-822c-c542c37781c9}{238}"&gt;[At MIT,] Being an officer in the reserves is seen as a benefit, not a distraction. No one says, “He's gone again for his military duties at the Pentagon. He's not doing his work.” Instead, my work is viewed as an advantage for the Institute. MIT is a special place for the veteran and military community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="WACViewPanel_ClipboardElement" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="866435518" paraeid="{aa1d9d45-7ac8-4658-a0ea-c3011ef3245f}{49}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a href="https://iceo.mit.edu/employee-resource-groups/veterans-and-military-erg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Veteran and Military Employee Resource Group (ERG)&lt;/a&gt; was recently launched at MIT. What do you hope will come from the ERG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1400388239" paraeid="{aa1d9d45-7ac8-4658-a0ea-c3011ef3245f}{74}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keselman:&lt;/strong&gt; The ERG once again underscores the uniqueness of MIT. Recruiter Nicolette Clifford from Human Resources and I had the idea for the group, but I thought, “Would anyone want this?” The reception from MIT Human Resources was positive and reinforcing. To put veterans and military into a supported group and make them feel like they have a home is amazing. I was blown away by it. We don’t usually get this kind of treatment. People thank us for our service, but then move on. It sends a message that MIT is a very friendly place for veterans. It also shows that MIT supports the people that defend our national security and support our way of life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For graduate students Kelsey Pittman and Jacqueline Orr, service in the U.S. military led to their interest in engineering, and to the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittman’s first exposure to the military and engineering took place during her undergraduate years at the United States Military Academy West Point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember back in high school, my dad kind of planted the seed of going to a military academy,” says Pittman.&amp;nbsp; While she admitted to feeling overwhelmed about the prospect of going to college at that time, her father’s rationale for West Point resonated with her.&amp;nbsp;“I’m a structured person and I like routine,” she says — two aspects the environment at West Point provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Pittman’s father hadn’t attended a military academy or served in the military, he was a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 25 years, and her family connections provided Pittman with valuable perspectives on West Point. It ended up being the only undergraduate program Pittman applied to. “I just wanted to be part of something bigger than myself, and all the opportunity West Point could give was pretty incredible,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittman’s parents also recognized her passion for design and encouraged her to consider a career in architecture. Although West Point didn’t offer an architecture program, she chose civil engineering, a field that allowed her to combine her love of math and design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating, she was commissioned as an engineer officer in the U.S. Army and has served for over seven years. She is now pursuing her graduate education at MIT in structural engineering with advisor John Ochsendorf, professor of civil and environmental engineering and architecture. Pittman is researching Gothic-style infrastructure for its masonry resiliency and stability over time, specifically Beauvais Cathedral and its structural safety. One of the reasons she chose to pursue her graduate studies in CEE was the department’s openness to explore diverse research opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was really drawn to the ability to carve my own research niche and have the freedom to figure out what really interests me, rather than being presented with a limited set of research options,” says Pittman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After receiving her master’s degree, Pittman will return to West Point as a faculty member for three years and then continue her service obligation in the Army. She credits her mentors at West Point as being instrumental in her academic and professional journey and hopes to play a role in shaping the lives of future generations of cadets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have incredible mentors that I still talk to, and I really wanted to be able to go back and give back to a place, and the people that gave me so much support and room to grow and find my passion. Every step has been made in my career so far to get back to West Point and teach in the civil engineering department.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pittman also acknowledges and values the Army for the opportunities it has provided her, particularly the chance to pursue her master’s degree at MIT, the relationships she has built along the way and career path it has opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve enjoyed getting to know the soldiers from all over the world and seeing them in this environment where you might give each other a hard time, but at the end of the day you know that you have each other’s back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline Orr, also a U.S. Military Academy&amp;nbsp;graduate, is currently pursuing a master’s degree in structural engineering under the guidance of Josephine Carstensen, the Gilbert W. Winslow Career Development Associate Professor&amp;nbsp;for Civil and Environmental Engineering. Inspired by her father to pursue a strong foundation in math and science, she earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. After graduation, she fulfilled her service obligation and served for six years as a member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade based in Vicenza, Italy — a unit renowned for its history, combat readiness, and crucial part of the Army’s joint integration with NATO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on her experience, Orr says, “Airborne units, like many great units in the Army, require overcoming an additional litmus test — in this case, conquering the fear of jumping from high-performance aircraft, hundreds of feet above the ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she enjoyed her time in the Army, her experiences ultimately led her to pursue a career more closely aligned with her passion for engineering. “When I was studying mechanical engineering, I developed a strong interest in structures during my senior design project,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She particularly enjoyed learning how to model structures and analyze how they respond to various forces. She felt that the traditional methods taught in her classes lacked an optimization component, which sparked her interest in topology optimization as a potential solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This desire to further explore topology optimization — specifically in relation to structures and their behavior under different forces — motivated her to seek graduate programs specializing in this field. Orr applied for and was awarded a Department of Defense (DoD) SMART Scholarship that brought her to MIT to study topology optimization in the Carstensen Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT was the ideal institution to pursue this research due to Professor Carstensen’s expertise and innovative work happening in the civil and environmental engineering department,” Orr says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Orr plans to apply the knowledge gained at MIT to a research-oriented career as part of her obligation as a DoD SMART Scholar.&amp;nbsp;But for now, she’s adjusting to life as a graduate student. “I’m really enjoying my classes and getting to know people in the lab — it’s been an amazing experience,” she adds.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Connecting the US Coast Guard to MIT Sloan</title>

  <description><![CDATA[For the past 50 years, the Coast Guard has nominated a senior officer to apply to the MIT Sloan Fellows MBA program. “When you leave MIT Sloan, you want to change the world,” says one alumnus.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Andrew Husband | MIT Sloan School of Management</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jim Ellis II SM ’80 first learned about a special opportunity for members of the U.S. Coast Guard while stationed in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My commander had received a notice from headquarters about this opportunity. They were asking for recommendations for an officer who might be interested,” says Ellis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity in question was the MIT Sloan Fellows program, today known as the &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/mit-sloan-fellows-mba-program/introduce-yourself" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Sloan Fellows MBA (SFMBA) program&lt;/a&gt;. Every year for 50 years, the Coast Guard has nominated a service member to apply to the program. Fifty Sloan Fellows and two Management of Technology participants have graduated since 1976, and the 53rd student is currently enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his tour nearly over, Ellis followed his commander’s recommendation to apply. The Coast Guard nominated him and his application to MIT Sloan School of Management was accepted. In 1980, Ellis became the fifth-ever Coast Guard Sloan Fellow to graduate due to the special arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My experience at MIT Sloan has been instrumental throughout my entire career,” says Ellis, who, with his wife Margaret Brady, designated half of their bequest to support graduate fellowships through the &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/mit-sloan-veterans-fund" title="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/mit-sloan-veterans-fund" data-outlook-id="d209953c-3195-4cb7-b897-c64f2f3d379f"&gt;MIT Sloan Veterans Fund&lt;/a&gt; and half to establish the &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/27/1074015/james-ellis-ii-sm-80-and-margaret-brady/" target="_blank" title="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/27/1074015/james-ellis-ii-sm-80-and-margaret-brady/" data-outlook-id="6ec4e1f7-3e19-4e28-b5ad-677f7694571a"&gt;Ellis/Brady Family Fund&lt;/a&gt; to support the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The success of the people who have been through the program is a testament to why the Coast Guard continues the program,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The desire to change the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout its 163-year history, MIT has maintained strong relationships with the U.S. military through programs like the MIT Reserve Officers' Training Corps, the 2N Graduate Program in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-standing collaboration between MIT Sloan and the Coast Guard adds to this history. According to &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/staff/directory/johanna-hising-difabio" target="_blank"&gt;Johanna Hising DiFabio&lt;/a&gt;, assistant dean for executive degree programs at MIT Sloan, it demonstrates the Coast Guard’s dedication to leadership development, as well as the unique benefits MIT Sloan has to offer service members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially evident in the careers of the 52 Coast Guard Sloan Fellow alumni, many of whom the program often invites to speak to current students. “It is inspiring to hear our alumni reflect on how this education has significantly influenced their careers and the considerable impact they have had on the Coast Guard and the global community,” says DiFabio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Anne O’Connell MBA ’19 says, “It is very rewarding to be able to pay it back, to look for those officers coming up behind you who should absolutely be offered the same opportunities, and to help them chart that course. I think it's hugely important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable Coast Guard Sloan Fellows is Retired Admiral Thad Allen SM ’89, who served as commandant of the Coast Guard from 2006 to 2010. One of the service’s youngest-ever flag officers, Allen is a figure beloved by current and former guardsmen. As commandant, he embraced new digital technologies, championed further arctic exploration, and solidified relations with the other armed services, federal partners, and private industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you leave MIT Sloan, you want to change the world,” says Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by his father, who enlisted after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Allen attended the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and subsequently held various commands at sea and ashore during a career spanning four decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years before the end of his second decade, Allen learned about the Sloan Fellows Program through a service-wide solicitation. “The people I worked for believed this would be a great opportunity, and that it would match with my skill set,” says Allen. With the guidance of his senior captains, he applied to MIT Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen matriculated with a cohort whose members included Carly Fiorina SM ’89, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard; Daniel Hesse SM ’89, former CEO of Sprint; and Robert Malone SM ’89, former chair and president of BP America. Though he initially felt a sharp disconnect between his national service experience and their global private sector knowledge, Allen realized everyone in the cohort were becoming his peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong bonds with global perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Allen, many of the Coast Guard Sloan Fellows acknowledge just how powerful their cohorts were when they matriculated, as well as how influential they have remained since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have classmates with giant perspectives and unique expertise in places all over the world. It’s remarkable,” says Retired Commander Catherine Kang MBA ’06, who served as deputy of financial transformation for Allen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of SFMBA candidates come to Cambridge from around the world. For example, the 2023–24 cohort comprised 76 percent international citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Coast Guard Sloan Fellows with decades of domestic experience, their cohort’s global perspectives are as novel as they are informative. As Retired Captain Gregory Sanial SM ’07 explains, “We had students from 30 to 40 different countries, and I had the opportunity to learn a lot about different parts of the world and open up my mind to many different experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Coast Guard, Sanial pursued a doctoral degree in organizational leadership and a career in higher education that, professionally, has kept him stateside. Yet the bonds he built at MIT Sloan remain just as strong and as international as they were when he first arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Coast Guard Sloan Fellows attribute this to the program’s focus on cooperation and social events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What impressed me most when I first got there were the team-building exercises, which made a difference in getting a group of diverse people to really gel and work together,” says Retired Captain Lisa Festa SM ’92, SM ’99. “MIT Sloan takes the time at the beginning to invest in you and to make sure you know the people you’re going through school with for the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent Coast Guard Sloan Fellow alumnus, Commander Mark Ketchum MBA ’24, says his cohort’s connections are still fresh, but he believes they will last a lifetime. Considering the testimonies of his predecessors, this may very well be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My cohort made me stronger, and I would like to think that I imparted my strengths onto my classmates,” says Ketchum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big challenges with high impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before earning the Coast Guard’s nomination and an acceptance letter from the SFMBA program, potential Sloan Fellows have already served in various leadership positions. Once they graduate, the recognition and distinction that comes with an MIT Sloan degree is quick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, too, are the more challenging leadership tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Allen served as deputy program manager for the Coast Guard’s shipbuilding program at the behest of the then-commandant. “For the agency head to say, ‘This is a bad problem, so I’m picking the next graduate from MIT Sloan,’ is indicative of the program’s cachet value,” he says. Allen then served in the office of budget and programs, a challenging and rewarding post that has become a hub for Coast Guard Sloan Fellows past, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Rear Admiral Jason Tama MBA ’11 and Captain Brian Erickson MBA ’21, both of whom credit the office with introducing them to the vigorous work ethic necessary for both obtaining an MIT Sloan education and for becoming an effective leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Never in a thousand years would I have gone on the resource management path until a mentor told me it would be one of the most challenging and high-impact things I could do,” says Tama. “You can never be fully prepared for the Sloan Fellows experience, but it can and will change you for the better. It changed the way I approach problems and challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I owe MIT for the senior-level opportunities I’ve had in this organization, and I will probably owe them for some of the opportunities I may get in the future,” adds Erickson. “You should never, ever say no to this opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the early cohorts of Ellis, Allen, and Festa, to more recent alumni like O’Connell, Kang, and Ketchum, Coast Guard Sloan Fellows from the past half-century echo Erickson and Tama’s sentiments when asked about how MIT Sloan has changed them. Words like “challenge,” “opportunity,” and “impact” are used often and with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believe joining the SFMBA program as up-and-coming senior leaders is an incredible opportunity for the individual and the Coast Guard, as well as the MIT community and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am excited to see this tradition carry on,” says Tama. “I hope others who are considering it can see the potential and the value, not only for themselves, but for the Coast Guard as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participation by U.S. Coast Guard members in this highlight of prior MIT Sloan Fellows is not intended as, and does not constitute an endorsement of, the MIT Sloan Fellows MBA program or MIT by either the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Despite its impressive output, generative AI doesn’t have a coherent understanding of the world</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large language models can do impressive things, like write poetry or generate viable computer programs, even though these models are trained to predict words that come next in a piece of text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such surprising capabilities can make it seem like the models are implicitly learning some general truths about the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that isn’t necessarily the case, according to a new study. The researchers found that a popular type of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/explained-generative-ai-1109" target="_blank"&gt;generative AI model&lt;/a&gt; can provide turn-by-turn driving directions in New York City with near-perfect accuracy — without having formed an accurate internal map of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the model’s uncanny ability to navigate effectively, when the researchers closed some streets and added detours, its performance plummeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they dug deeper, the researchers found that the New York maps the model implicitly generated had many nonexistent streets curving between the grid and connecting far away intersections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could have serious implications for generative AI models deployed in the real world, since a model that seems to be performing well in one context might break down if the task or environment slightly changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One hope is that, because LLMs can accomplish all these amazing things in language, maybe we could use these same tools in other parts of science, as well. But the question of whether LLMs are learning coherent world models is very important if we want to use these techniques to make new discoveries,” says senior author Ashesh Rambachan, assistant professor of economics and a principal investigator in the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rambachan is joined on a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03689" target="_blank"&gt;paper about the work&lt;/a&gt; by lead author Keyon Vafa, a postdoc at Harvard University; Justin Y. Chen, an electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate student at MIT; Jon Kleinberg, Tisch University Professor of Computer Science and Information Science at Cornell University; and Sendhil Mullainathan, an MIT professor in the departments of EECS and of Economics, and a member of LIDS. The research will be presented at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a type of generative AI model known as a transformer, which forms the backbone of LLMs like GPT-4. Transformers are trained on a massive amount of language-based data to predict the next token in a sequence, such as the next word in a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if scientists want to determine whether an LLM has formed an accurate model of the world, measuring the accuracy of its predictions doesn’t go far enough, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, they found that a transformer can predict valid moves in a game of Connect 4 nearly every time without understanding any of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the team developed two new metrics that can test a transformer’s world model. The researchers focused their evaluations on a class of problems called deterministic finite automations, or DFAs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DFA is a problem with a sequence of states, like intersections one must traverse to reach a destination, and a concrete way of describing the rules one must follow along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They chose two problems to formulate as DFAs: navigating on streets in New York City and playing the board game Othello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We needed test beds where we know what the world model is. Now, we can rigorously think about what it means to recover that world model,” Vafa explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first metric they developed, called sequence distinction, says a model has formed a coherent world model it if sees two different states, like two different Othello boards, and recognizes how they are different. Sequences, that is, ordered lists of data points, are what transformers use to generate outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second metric, called sequence compression, says a transformer with a coherent world model should know that two identical states, like two identical Othello boards, have the same sequence of possible next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used these metrics to test two common classes of transformers, one which is trained on data generated from randomly produced sequences and the other on data generated by following strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incoherent world models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the researchers found that transformers which made choices randomly formed more accurate world models, perhaps because they saw a wider variety of potential next steps during training.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Othello, if you see two random computers playing rather than championship players, in theory you’d see the full set of possible moves, even the bad moves championship players wouldn’t make,” Vafa explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the transformers generated accurate directions and valid Othello moves in nearly every instance, the two metrics revealed that only one generated a coherent world model for Othello moves, and none performed well at forming coherent world models in the wayfinding example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers demonstrated the implications of this by adding detours to the map of New York City, which caused all the navigation models to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was surprised by how quickly the performance deteriorated as soon as we added a detour. If we close just 1 percent of the possible streets, accuracy immediately plummets from nearly 100 percent to just 67 percent,” Vafa says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they recovered the city maps the models generated, they looked like an imagined New York City with hundreds of streets crisscrossing overlaid on top of the grid. The maps often contained random flyovers above other streets or multiple streets with impossible orientations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results show that transformers can perform surprisingly well at certain tasks without understanding the rules. If scientists want to build LLMs that can capture accurate world models, they need to take a different approach, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often, we see these models do impressive things and think they must have understood something about the world. I hope we can convince people that this is a question to think very carefully about, and we don’t have to rely on our own intuitions to answer it,” says Rambachan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to tackle a more diverse set of problems, such as those where some rules are only partially known. They also want to apply their evaluation metrics to real-world, scientific problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is funded, in part, by the Harvard Data Science Initiative, a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, a Simons Collaboration grant, and a grant from the MacArthur Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The banging on the tables begins almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s September, and the 53 first-year students in MIT’s Concourse program are debating the pros and cons of capitalism during one of their Friday lunchtime seminars in Building 16. Sasha Rickard ’19 — assistant director of Concourse and the chair, or moderator, of the debate — reminds everyone of the rules: “Stand when you speak, address your questions and comments to the chair, and if you hear someone saying something you support, give them a little bang on the table.” The first speaker walks to the podium, praises the benefits of capitalism for her allotted four minutes, and is rewarded with a cacophony of table-banging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Other students jump up to question her argument. The next speaker takes the opposite view, denouncing capitalism. For nearly two hours, there are more speeches on both sides of the issue, more questions, more enthusiastic banging on tables. Participants call the back-and-forth “intellectually serious,” “genuine good-faith engagement,” and “incredibly fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The debate is one of the cornerstones of MIT’s Civil Discourse Project, a joint venture between the Concourse program and philosophy professors Brad Skow and Alex Byrne. The premise behind the Civil Discourse Project is that first-year students who practice talking and listening to each other even when they disagree will become more thoughtful and open-minded citizens, during their time at MIT and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It’s consistent with free expression and free speech, but also consistent with the mission of the university, which is teaching and learning and getting to a greater sense of the truth,” says Linda Rabieh, a senior lecturer in the Concourse program and co-leader of the Civil Discourse Project with Skow, Byrne, and Concourse Director Anne McCants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The project appears to be working. First-year Ace Chun, one of the student debaters, says,“It’s easy to just say, ‘Well, you have your opinion and I have mine,’ or ‘You're wrong and I'm right.’ But going through the process of disagreement and coming up with a more informed position feels really important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's debatable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Funded by the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the project launched in fall 2023 as a series of paired events. First, two scholars with opposing views on a particular subject — often one from MIT and one from another institution — participate in a formal debate on campus. A week or two later, the Concourse students, having seen the first debate, hold their own version on the same topic. Past debates have explored feminism, climate change, Covid-19 public-health policies, and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This year’s first scholar debate explored the question “Is capitalism defensible?” and featured economist Tyler Cowen of George Mason University, who argued in the affirmative, and political scientist Alex Gourevitch of Brown University, who vigorously disagreed. Roughly 350 people registered to watch the two take turns delivering prepared remarks and answering audience questions in a large auditorium in the Stata Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These debates are open to everyone at MIT, as well as the public. They are not recorded or livestreamed because, Skow says, “we want people to feel free to say whatever’s on their mind without worrying that it’s going to be on the internet forever.” Concourse students in attendance look for ideas for what they might say in their own debate, but also, Rabieh says,&amp;nbsp;how they might say it. Cowen and Gourevitch remained respectful even when their exchanges grew louder and hotter, and they ended the evening with a handshake. Students “were seeing reasonable people disagree,” Rabieh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Five or six years ago, Rabieh had begun to notice a reluctance among students to talk about controversial ideas; they didn’t want to risk offending anyone. “Most MIT students spend a lot of their time doing math, science, or engineering, and it’s tempting for them to take refuge in the certainty of quantitative reasoning,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today’s combative political and cultural landscape can make it even harder to get students talking about hot-button issues, and as a result, civil discourse has become something of a holy grail in higher education. Some institutions (including MIT) now incorporate free-speech exercises into their orientation programs; others host “conversation” events or offer special faculty training. Byrne sees MIT’s Civil Discourse Project, with its connection to the Concourse curriculum, as consistent, pragmatic, hands-on learning. “We’re talking instead of just talking about talking,” he says. “It's like swimming. It’s all very well to hear a lecture about pool etiquette — stay in your lane, don't dive-bomb your fellow swimmers — but at some point, you have to actually get in the pool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning to argue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Concourse’s “pool” can be found in a student lounge in Building 16. That’s where a group of “debate fellows” — older students who have gone through the Concourse program themselves — coach the first-year students in crafting statements and speeches that can be presented at a debate. It’s also where the fellows help Rabieh and Rickard adapt the original debate question into a resolution the younger students can reasonably argue about. “Our students are still figuring out what they think about a lot of things,” Rickard says. So, the question debated by Cowen and Gourevitch — Is capitalism defensible? — becomes: “Capitalism is the best economic system because it prioritizes freedom and material wealth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The first-year students jumped in. During their lunchtime debate, they crowded around tables, ate lasagna and salad, and waited their turn at the podium. They told personal stories to illustrate their points. They tried arguing in support of an idea that they actually disagreed with. They admitted when they were stumped. “That’s a tricky question,” one of the speakers conceded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“At a place like MIT, it’s easy to get caught up in your own world, like ‘I have this big assignment or I have this paper due,’” says debate fellow and senior Isaac Lock. “With the Civil Discourse Project, students are thinking about big ideas, maybe not having super-strong, solid opinions, but they’re at least considering them in ways that they probably haven’t done before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;They’re also learning what a balanced conversation feels like. The student debates use a format developed by Braver Angels, a national organization that holds workshops and debates to try to bridge the partisan divide that exists in the United States today. With strict time limits and room for both prepared speeches and spontaneous remarks, the format “allows different types of people to speak,” says debate fellow Arianna Doss, a sophomore. “Because of the debates, we're better-equipped to articulate our points and provide nuance — why I believe what I believe — while also acknowledging and understanding the shortcomings of our arguments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Civil Discourse Project will publish more about its spring semester lectures &lt;a href="https://civildiscourse.mit.edu/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. Coleman Hughes, author of “The End of Race Politics: Arguments for a Colorblind America,” will be on campus March 3, and a debate on the relevance of legacy media is being planned for later in the semester.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Study: Hospice care provides major Medicare savings</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hospice care aims to provide a health care alternative for people nearing the end of life by sparing them unwanted medical procedures and focusing on the patient’s comfort. A new study co-authored by MIT scholars shows hospice also has a clear fiscal benefit: It generates substantial savings for the U.S. Medicare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examines the growth of for-profit hospice providers, who receive reimbursements from Medicare, and evaluates the cost of caring for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). The research finds that for patients using for-profit hospice providers, there is about a $29,000 savings to Medicare over the first five years after someone is diagnosed with ADRD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hospice is saving Medicare a lot of money,” says Jonathan Gruber, an MIT health care economist and co-author of a paper detailing the study’s findings. “Those are big numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, hospice care has grown substantially. That growth has been accompanied by concerns that for-profit hospice organizations, in particular, might be overly aggressive in pursuing patients. There have also been instances of fraud by organizations in the field. And yet, the study shows that the overall dynamics of hospice are the intended ones: People are indeed receiving palliative-type care, based around comfort rather than elaborate medical procedures, at less cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we found is that hospice basically operates as advertised,” adds Gruber, the Ford Professor of Economics at MIT. “It does not extend lives on aggregate, and it does save money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20230328&amp;amp;&amp;amp;from=f" target="_blank"&gt;Dying or Lying? For-Profit Hospices and End of Life Care&lt;/a&gt;,” appears in the &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/em&gt;. The co-authors are Gruber, who is also head of MIT’s Department of Economics; David Howard, a professor at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University; Jetson Leder-Luis PhD ’20, an assistant professor at Boston University; and Theodore Caputi, a doctoral student in MIT’s Department of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charting what more hospice access means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospice care in the U.S. dates to at least the 1970s. Patients opt out of their existing medical network and receive nursing care where they live, either at home or in care facilities. That care is oriented around reducing suffering and pain, rather than attempting to eliminate underlying causes. Generally, hospice patients are expected to have six months or less to live. Most Medicare funding goes to private contractors supplying medical care, and in the 1980s the federal government started using Medicare to reimburse the medical expenses from hospice as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the number of nonprofit hospice providers in the U.S. has remained fairly consistent, the number of for-profit hospice organizations grew fivefold between 2000 and 2019. Medicare payments for hospice care are now about $20 billion annually, up from $2.5 billion in 1999. People diagnosed with ADRD now make up 38 percent of hospice patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Gruber considers the topic of hospice care relatively under-covered by analysts. To conduct the study, the team examined over 10 million patients from 1999 through 2019. The researchers used the growth of for-profit hospice providers to compare the effects of being enrolled in non-profit hospice care, for-profit hospice care, or staying in the larger medical system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means the scholars were not only evaluating hospice patients; by evaluating the larger population in a given area where and when for-profit hospice firms opened their doors, they could see what difference greater access to hospice care made. For instance, having a new for-profit hospice open locally is associated with a roughly 2 percentage point increase in for-profit hospice admissions in following years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re able to use this methodology to [analyze] if these patients would otherwise have not gone to hospice or would have gone to a nonprofit hospice,” Gruber says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method also allows the scholars to estimate the substantial cost savings. And it shows that enrolling in hospice increased the five-year post-diagnosis mortality rate of ADRD patients by 8.6 percentage points, from a baseline of 66.6 percent. Entering into hospice care — which is a reversible decision — means foregoing life-extending surgeries, for instance, if people believe such procedures are no longer desirable for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking the cap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By providing care without more expensive medical procedures, it is understandable that hospice reduces overall medical costs. Still, given that Medicare reimburses hospice organizations, one ongoing policy concern is that hospice providers might aggressively recruit a larger percentage of patients who end up living longer than six additional months. In this way hospice providers might unduly boost their revenues and put more pressure on the Medicare budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counteract this, Medicare rules include a roughly $29,205 cap on per-patient reimbursements, as of 2019. Most patients die relatively soon after entering hospice care; some will outlive the six-month expectation significantly. But hospice organizations cannot exceed that average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study also suggests the cap is a suboptimal approach. In 2018, 15.5 percent of hospice patients were being discharged from hospice care while still alive, due to the cap limiting hospice capacity. As the paper notes, “patients in hospices facing cap pressure are more likely to be discharged from hospice alive and experience higher mortality rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gruber notes, the spending cap is partly a fraud-fighting tool. And yet the cap clearly has other, unintended consquences on patients and their medical choices, crowding some out of the hospice system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cap may be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.” Gruber says. “The government has more focused tools to fight fraud. Using the cap for that is a blunt instrument.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as people are informed about hospice and the medical trajectory it puts them on, then, hospice care appears to be providing a valued service at less expense than other approaches to end-of-life care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The holy grail in health care is things that improve quality and save money,” Gruber says. “And with hospice, there are surveys saying people like it. And it certainly saves money, and there’s no evidence it’s doing harm [to patients]. We talk about how we struggle to deal with health care costs in this country, so this seems like what we want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was supported in part by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
