  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rohit Karnik, the Tata Professor in the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering, has been named the new director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), effective March 1. Karnik, who has served as associate director of J-WAFS since 2023, succeeds founding director John H. Lienhard V, Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Water and Mechanical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnik assumes the role of director at a pivotal time for J-WAFS, as it celebrates its 10th anniversary. Announcing the appointment today in a letter to the J-WAFS research community, Vice President for Research Ian A. Waitz noted Karnik’s deep involvement with the lab’s research efforts and programming, as well as his accolades as a researcher, teacher, leader, and mentor. “I am delighted that Rohit will bring his talent and vision to bear on the J-WAFS mission, ensuring the program sustains its direct support of research on campus and its important impact around the world,” Waitz wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS is the only program at MIT focused exclusively on water and food research. Since 2015, the lab has made grants totaling approximately $25M to researchers across the Institute, including from all five schools and 40 departments, labs, and centers. It has supported 300 faculty, research staff, and students combined. Furthermore, the J-WAFS Solutions Program, which supports efforts to commercialize innovative water and food technologies, has spun out 12 companies and two open-sourced products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We launched J-WAFS with the aim of building a community of water and food researchers at MIT, taking advantage of MIT’s strengths in so many disciplines that contribute to these most essential human needs,” writes Lienhard, who will retire this June. “After a decade’s work, that community is strong and visible. I am delighted that Rohit has agreed to take the reins. He will bring the program to the next level.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lienhard has served as director since founding J-WAFS in 2014, along with executive director Renee J. Robins ’83, who last fall shared her intent to retire as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big change for a program to turn over both the director and executive director roles at the same time,” says Robins. “Having worked alongside Rohit as our associate director for the past couple of years, I am greatly assured that J-WAFS will be in good hands with a new and steady leadership team.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnik became associate director of J-WAFS in July 2023, a move that coincided with the start of a sabbatical for Lienhard. Before that time, Karnik was already well engaged with J-WAFS as a grant recipient, reviewer, and community member. As associate director, Rohit has been integral to J-WAFS operations, planning, and grant management, including the proposal selection process. He was instrumental in planning the second J-WAFS Grand Challenge grant and led workshops at which researchers brainstormed proposal topics and formed teams. Karnik also engaged with J-WAFS’ corporate partners, helped plan lectures and events, and offered project oversight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The experience gave me broad exposure to the amazing ideas and research at MIT in the water and food space, and the collaborations and synergies across departments and schools that enable excellence in research,” says Karnik. “The strengths of J-WAFS lie in being able to support principal investigators in pursuing research to address humanity’s water and food needs; in creating a community of students though the fellowship program and support of student clubs; and in bringing people together at seminars, workshops, and other events. All of this is made possible by the endowment and a dedicated team with close involvement in the projects after the grants are awarded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS was established through a generous gift from &lt;a href="https://www.communityjameel.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Community Jameel&lt;/a&gt;, an independent, global organization advancing science to help communities thrive in a rapidly changing world. The lab was named in honor of the late Abdul Latif Jameel, the founder of the Abdul Latif Jameel company and father of MIT alumnus Mohammed Jameel ’78, who founded and chairs Community Jameel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS’ operations are carried out by a small but passionate team of people at MIT who are dedicated to the mission of securing water and food systems. That mission is more important than ever, as climate change, urbanization, and a growing global population are putting tremendous stress on the world’s water and food supplies. These challenges drive J-WAFS’ efforts to mobilize the research, innovation, and technology that can sustainably secure humankind’s most vital resources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As director, Karnik will help shape the research agenda and key priorities for J-WAFS and usher the program into its second decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnik originally joined MIT as a postdoc in the departments of Mechanical and Chemical Engineering in October 2006. In September 2007, he became an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, before being promoted to associate professor in 2012. His research group focuses on the physics of micro- and nanofluidic flows and applying that to the design of micro- and nanofluidic systems for applications in water, healthcare, energy, and the environment. Past projects include ones on membranes for water filtration and chemical separations, sensors for water, and water filters from waste wood. Karnik has served as associate department head and interim co-department head in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. He also serves as faculty director of the New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET) program in the School of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before coming to MIT, Karnik received a bachelor’s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, and a master’s and PhD from the University of California at Berkeley, all in mechanical engineering. He has authored numerous publications, is co-inventor on several patents, and has received awards and honors including the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the U.S. Department of Energy Early Career Award, the MIT Office of Graduate Education’s Committed to Caring award, and election to the National Academy of Inventors as a senior member.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lienhard, J-WAFS’ outgoing director, has served on the MIT faculty since 1988. His research and educational efforts have focused on heat and mass transfer, water purification and desalination, thermodynamics, and separation processes. Lienhard has directly supervised more than 90 PhD and master’s theses, and he is the author of over 300 peer-reviewed papers and three textbooks. He holds more than 40 U.S. patents, most commercialized through startup companies with his students. One of these, the water treatment company Gradiant Corporation, is now valued over $1 billion and employs more than 1,200 people. Lienhard has received many awards, including the 2024 Lifetime Achievement Award of the International Desalination and Reuse Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1998, Renee Robins has worked on the conception, launch, and development of a number of large interdisciplinary, international, and partnership-based research and education collaborations at MIT and elsewhere. She served in roles for the Cambridge MIT Institute, the MIT Portugal Program, the Mexico City Program, the Program on Emerging Technologies, and the Technology and Policy Program. She holds two undergraduate degrees from MIT, in biology and humanities/anthropology, and a master’s degree in public policy from Carnegie Mellon University. She has overseen significant growth in J-WAFS’ activities, funding, staffing, and collaborations over the past decade. In 2021, she was awarded an Infinite Mile Award in the area of the Offices of the Provost and Vice President for Research, in recognition of her contributions within her role at J-WAFS to help the Institute carry out its mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“John and Renee have done a remarkable job in establishing J-WAFS and bringing it up to its present form,” says Karnik. “I’m committed to making sure that the key aspects of J-WAFS that bring so much value to the MIT community, the nation, and the world continue to function well. MIT researchers and alumni in the J-WAFS community are already having an impact on addressing humanity’s water and food needs, and I believe that there is potential for MIT to have an even greater positive impact on securing humanity’s vital resources in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rain can freefall at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour. If the droplets land in a puddle or pond, they can form a crown-like splash that, with enough force, can dislodge any surface particles and launch them into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now MIT scientists have taken high-speed videos of droplets splashing into a deep pool, to track how the fluid evolves, above and below the water line, frame by millisecond frame. Their work could help to predict how spashing droplets, such as from rainstorms and irrigation systems, may impact watery surfaces and aerosolize surface particles, such as pollen on puddles or pesticides in agricultural runoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out experiments in which they dispensed water droplets of various sizes and from various heights into a pool of water. Using high-speed imaging, they measured how the liquid pool deformed as the impacting droplet hit the pool’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all their experiments, they observed a common splash evolution: As a droplet hit the pool, it pushed down below the surface to form a “crater,” or cavity. At nearly the same time, a wall of liquid rose above the surface, forming a crown. Interestingly, the team observed that small, secondary droplets were ejected from the crown before the crown reached its maximum height. This entire evolution happens in a fraction of a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have caught snapshots of droplet splashes in the past, such as the famous “&lt;a href="https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/collections/object/HEE-NC-57001" target="_blank"&gt;Milk Drop Coronet&lt;/a&gt;” — a photo of a drop of milk in mid-splash, taken by the late MIT professor Harold “Doc” Edgerton, who invented a photographic technique to capture quickly moving objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work represents the first time scientists have used such high-speed images to model the entire splash dynamics of a droplet in a deep pool, combining what happens both above and below the surface. The team has used the imaging to gather new data central to build a mathematical model that predicts how a droplet’s shape will morph and merge as it hits a pool’s surface. They plan to use the model as a baseline to explore to what extent a splashing droplet might drag up and launch particles from the water pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Impacts of drops on liquid layers are ubiquitous,”&amp;nbsp;says study author Lydia Bourouiba, a professor in the MIT departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, and a core member of the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES). “Such impacts can produce myriads of secondary droplets that could&amp;nbsp;act as carriers for pathogens, particles, or microbes that are on the surface of impacted pools or contaminated water bodies. This work is key in enabling prediction of droplet size distributions, and potentially&amp;nbsp;also what such drops can carry with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bourouiba and her mentees have &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/splash-on-a-liquid-pool-coupled-cavitysheet-unsteady-dynamics/1DC718032999AE56714953CD0B52B60F" target="_blank"&gt;published their results in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Fluid Mechanics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. MIT co-authors include former graduate student Raj Dandekar PhD ’22, postdoc (Eric) Naijian Shen, and student mentee Boris Naar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Above and below&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Bourouiba heads up the Fluid Dynamics of Disease Transmission Laboratory, part of the Fluids and Health Network, where she and her team explore the fundamental physics of fluids and droplets in a range of environmental, energy, and health contexts, including disease transmission. For their new study, the team looked to better understand how droplets impact a deep pool — a seemingly simple phenomenon that nevertheless has been tricky to precisely capture and characterize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bourouiba notes that there have been recent breakthroughs in modeling the evolution of a splashing droplet below a pool’s surface. As a droplet hits a pool of water, it breaks through the surface and drags air down through the pool to create a short-lived crater. Until now, scientists have focused on the evolution of this underwater cavity, mainly for applications in energy harvesting. What happens above the water, and how a droplet’s crown-like shape evolves with the cavity below, remained less understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The descriptions and understanding of what happens below the surface, and above, have remained very much divorced,” says Bourouiba, who believes such an understanding can help to predict how droplets launch and spread chemicals, particles, and microbes&amp;nbsp;into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splash in 3D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the coupled dynamics between a droplet’s cavity and crown, the team set up an experiment to dispense water droplets into a deep pool. For the purposes of their study, the researchers considered a deep pool to be a body of water that is deep enough that a splashing droplet would remain far away from the pool’s bottom. In these terms, they found that a pool with a depth of at least 20 centimeters was sufficient for their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They varied each droplet’s size, with an average diameter of about 5 millimeters. They also dispensed droplets from various heights, causing the droplets to hit the pool’s surface at different speeds, which on average was about 5 meters per second. The overall dynamics, Bourouiba says, should be similar to what occurs on the surface of a puddle or pond during an average rainstorm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is capturing the speed at which raindrops fall,” she says. “These wouldn’t be very small, misty drops. This would be rainstorm drops for which one needs an umbrella.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using high-speed imaging techniques inspired by Edgerton’s pioneering photography, the team captured videos of pool-splashing droplets, at rates of up to 12,500 frames per second. They then applied in-house imaging processing methods to extract key measurements from the image sequences, such as the changing width and depth of the underwater cavity, and the evolving diameter and height of the rising crown. The researchers also captured especially tricky measurements, of the crown’s wall thickness profile and inner flow — the cylinder that rises out of the pool, just before it forms a rim and points that are characteristic of a crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This cylinder-like wall of rising liquid, and how it evolves in time and space, is at the heart of everything,” Bourouiba says. “It’s what connects the fluid from the pool to what will go into the rim and then be ejected into the air through smaller, secondary droplets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers worked the image data into a set of “evolution equations,” or a mathematical model that relates the various properties of an&amp;nbsp;impacting droplet, such as the width of its cavity and the thickness and speed profiles of its crown wall, and how these properties change over time, given a droplet’s starting size and impact speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have a closed-form mathematical expression that people can use to see how all these quantities of a splashing droplet change over space and time,” says co-author Shen, who plans, with Bourouiba, to apply the new model to the behavior of secondary droplets and understanding how a splash end-up dispersing particles such as pathogens and pesticides. “This opens up the possibility to study all these problems of splash in 3D, with self-contained closed-formed equations, which was not possible before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by&amp;nbsp;the Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Specialty Crop Research Initiative; the Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation; the National Science Foundation; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Inditex; and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) has transformed the landscape of water and food research at MIT, driving faculty engagement and catalyzing new research and innovation in these critical areas. With philanthropic, corporate, and government support, J-WAFS’ strategic approach spans the entire research life cycle, from support for early-stage research to commercialization grants for more advanced projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, J-WAFS has invested approximately $25 million in direct research funding to support MIT faculty pursuing transformative research with the potential for significant impact. “Since awarding our first cohort of seed grants in 2015, it’s remarkable to look back and see that over 10 percent of the MIT faculty have benefited from J-WAFS funding,” observes J-WAFS Executive Director Renee J. Robins ’83. “Many of these professors hadn’t worked on water or food challenges before their first J-WAFS grant.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and supporting high-risk, high-reward projects, J-WAFS has amplified the capacity of MIT faculty to pursue groundbreaking research that addresses some of the world’s most pressing challenges facing our water and food systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawing MIT faculty to water and food research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS open calls for proposals enable faculty to explore bold ideas and develop impactful approaches to tackling critical water and food system challenges. Professor Patrick Doyle’s work in water purification exemplifies this impact. “Without J-WAFS, I would have never ventured into the field of water purification,” Doyle reflects. While previously focused on pharmaceutical manufacturing and drug delivery, exposure to J-WAFS-funded peers led him to apply his expertise in soft materials to water purification. “Both the funding and the J-WAFS community led me to be deeply engaged in understanding some of the key challenges in water purification and water security,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Professor Otto Cordero of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) leveraged J-WAFS funding to pivot his research into aquaculture. Cordero explains that his first J-WAFS seed grant “has been extremely influential for my lab because it allowed me to take a step in a new direction, with no preliminary data in hand.” Cordero’s expertise is in microbial communities. He was previous unfamiliar with aquaculture, but he saw the relevance of microbial communities the health of farmed aquatic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting early-career faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New assistant professors at MIT have particularly benefited from J-WAFS funding and support. J-WAFS has played a transformative role in shaping the careers and research trajectories of many new faculty members by encouraging them to explore novel research areas, and in many instances providing their first MIT research grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ariel Furst reflects on how pivotal J-WAFS’ investment has been in advancing her research. “This was one of the first grants I received after starting at MIT, and it has truly shaped the development of my group’s research program,” Furst explains. With J-WAFS’ backing, her lab has achieved breakthroughs in chemical detection and remediation technologies for water. “The support of J-WAFS has enabled us to develop the platform funded through this work beyond the initial applications to the general detection of environmental contaminants and degradation of those contaminants,” she elaborates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karthish Manthiram, now a professor of chemical engineering and chemistry at Caltech, explains how J-WAFS’ early investment enabled him and other young faculty to pursue ambitious ideas. “J-WAFS took a big risk on us,” Manthiram reflects. His research on breaking the nitrogen triple bond to make ammonia for fertilizer was initially met with skepticism. However, J-WAFS’ seed funding allowed his lab to lay the groundwork for breakthroughs that later attracted significant National Science Foundation (NSF) support. “That early funding from J-WAFS has been pivotal to our long-term success,” he notes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stories underscore the broad impact of J-WAFS’ support for early-career faculty, and its commitment to empowering them to address critical global challenges and innovate boldly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fueling follow-on funding&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS seed grants enable faculty to explore nascent research areas, but external funding for continued work is usually necessary to achieve the full potential of these novel ideas. “It’s often hard to get funding for early stage or out-of-the-box ideas,” notes J-WAFS Director Professor John H. Lienhard V. “My hope, when I founded J-WAFS in 2014, was that seed grants would allow PIs [principal investigators] to prove out novel ideas so that they would be attractive for follow-on funding. And after 10 years, J-WAFS-funded research projects have brought more than $21 million in subsequent awards to MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Retsef Levi led a seed study on how agricultural supply chains affect food safety, with a team of faculty spanning the MIT schools&amp;nbsp;Engineering and Science as well as the MIT Sloan School of Management. The team parlayed their seed grant research into a multi-million-dollar follow-on initiative. Levi reflects, “The J-WAFS seed funding allowed us to establish the initial credibility of our team, which was key to our success in obtaining large funding from several other agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Des Marais was an assistant professor in the Department of CEE when he received his first J-WAFS seed grant. The funding supported his research on how plant growth and physiology are controlled by genes and interact with the environment. The seed grant helped launch his lab’s work addressing enhancing climate change resilience in agricultural systems. The work led to his Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the NSF, a prestigious honor for junior faculty members. Now an associate professor, Des Marais’ ongoing project to further investigate the mechanisms and consequences of genomic and environmental interactions is supported by the five-year, $1,490,000 NSF grant. “J-WAFS providing essential funding to get my new research underway,” comments Des Marais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating interdisciplinary collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des Marais’ seed grant was also key to developing new collaborations. He explains, “the J-WAFS grant supported me to develop a collaboration with Professor Caroline Uhler in EECS/IDSS [the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science/Institute for Data, Systems, and Society] that really shaped how I think about framing and testing hypotheses. One of the best things about J-WAFS is facilitating unexpected connections among MIT faculty with diverse yet complementary skill sets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professors A. John Hart of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Benedetto Marelli of CEE also launched a new interdisciplinary collaboration with J-WAFS funding. They partnered to join expertise in biomaterials, microfabrication, and manufacturing, to create printed silk-based colorimetric sensors that detect food spoilage. “The J-WAFS Seed Grant provided a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary collaboration,” Hart notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professors Stephen Graves in the MIT Sloan School of Management and Bishwapriya Sanyal in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) partnered to pursue new research on agricultural supply chains. With field work in Senegal, their J-WAFS-supported project brought together international development specialists and operations management experts to study how small firms and government agencies influence access to and uptake of irrigation technology by poorer farmers. “We used J-WAFS to spur a collaboration that would have been improbable without this grant,” they explain. Being part of the J-WAFS community also introduced them to researchers in Professor Amos Winter’s lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering working on irrigation technologies for low-resource settings. DUSP doctoral candidate Mark Brennan notes, “We got to share our understanding of how irrigation markets and irrigation supply chains work in developing economies, and then we got to contrast that with their understanding of how irrigation system models work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy Swager, professor of chemistry, and Rohit Karnik, professor of mechanical engineering and J-WAFS associate director, collaborated on a sponsored research project supported by Xylem, Inc. through the J-WAFS Research Affiliate program. The cross-disciplinary research, which targeted the development of ultra-sensitive sensors for toxic PFAS chemicals, was conceived following a series of workshops hosted by J-WAFS. Swager and Karnik were two of the participants, and their involvement led to the collaborative proposal that Xylem funded. “J-WAFS funding allowed us to combine Swager lab’s expertise in sensing with my lab’s expertise in microfluidics to develop a cartridge for field-portable detection of PFAS,” says Karnik. “J-WAFS has enriched my research program in so many ways,” adds Swager, who is now working to commercialize the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving global collaboration and impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS has also helped MIT faculty establish and advance international collaboration and impactful global research. By funding and supporting projects that connect MIT researchers with international partners, J-WAFS has not only advanced technological solutions, but also strengthened cross-cultural understanding and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Matthew Shoulders leads the inaugural J-WAFS Grand Challenge project. In response to the first J-WAFS call for “Grand Challenge” proposals, Shoulders assembled an interdisciplinary team based at MIT to enhance and provide climate resilience to agriculture by improving the most inefficient aspect of photosynthesis, the notoriously-inefficient carbon dioxide-fixing plant enzyme RuBisCO. J-WAFS funded this high-risk/high-reward project following a competitive process that engaged external reviewers through a several rounds of iterative proposal development. The technical feedback to the team led them to researchers with complementary expertise&amp;nbsp;from the Australian National University. “Our collaborative team of biochemists and synthetic biologists, computational biologists, and chemists is deeply integrated with plant biologists and field trial experts, yielding a robust feedback loop for enzyme engineering,” Shoulders says. “Together, this team will be able to make a concerted effort using the most modern, state-of-the-art techniques to engineer crop RuBisCO with an eye to helping make meaningful gains in securing a stable crop supply, hopefully with accompanying improvements in both food and water security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Leon Glicksman and Research Engineer Eric Verploegen’s team designed a low-cost cooling chamber to preserve fruits and vegetables harvested by smallholder farmers with no access to cold chain storage. J-WAFS’ guidance motivated the team to prioritize practical considerations informed by local collaborators, ensuring market competitiveness. “As our new idea for a forced-air evaporative cooling chamber was taking shape, we continually checked that our solution was evolving in a direction that would be competitive in terms of cost, performance, and usability to existing commercial alternatives,” explains Verploegen, who is currently an MIT D-Lab affiliate. Following the team’s initial seed grant, the team secured a J-WAFS Solutions commercialization grant, which Verploegen say “further motivated us to establish partnerships with local organizations capable of commercializing the technology earlier in the project than we might have done otherwise.” The team has since shared an open-source design as part of its commercialization strategy to maximize accessibility and impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing corporate sponsored research opportunities to MIT faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS also plays a role in driving private partnerships, enabling collaborations that bridge industry and academia. Through its Research Affiliate Program, for example, J-WAFS provides opportunities for faculty to collaborate with industry on sponsored research, helping to convert scientific discoveries into licensable intellectual property (IP) that companies can turn into commercial products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS introduced professor of mechanical engineering Alex Slocum to a challenge presented by its research affiliate company, Xylem: how to design a more energy-efficient pump for fluctuating flows. With centrifugal pumps consuming an estimated 6 percent of U.S. electricity annually, Slocum and his then-graduate student Hilary Johnson SM '18, PhD '22 developed an innovative variable volute mechanism that reduces energy usage. “Xylem envisions this as the first in a new category of adaptive pump geometry,” comments Johnson. The research produced a pump prototype and related IP that Xylem is working on commercializing. Johnson notes that these outcomes “would not have been possible without J-WAFS support and facilitation of the Xylem industry partnership.” Slocum adds, “J-WAFS enabled Hilary to begin her work on pumps, and Xylem sponsored the research to bring her to this point … where she has an opportunity to do far more than the original project called for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swager speaks highly of the impact of corporate research sponsorship through J-WAFS on his research and technology translation efforts. His PFAS project with Karnik described above was also supported by Xylem. “Xylem was an excellent sponsor of our research. Their engagement and feedback were instrumental in advancing our PFAS detection technology, now on the path to commercialization,” Swager says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What J-WAFS has accomplished is more than a collection of research projects; a decade of impact demonstrates how J-WAFS’ approach has been transformative for many MIT faculty members. As Professor Mathias Kolle puts it, his engagement with J-WAFS “had a significant influence on how we think about our research and its broader impacts.” He adds that it “opened my eyes to the challenges in the field of water and food systems and the many different creative ideas that are explored by MIT.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thriving ecosystem of innovation, collaboration, and academic growth around water and food research has not only helped faculty build interdisciplinary and international partnerships, but has also led to the commercialization of transformative technologies with real-world applications. C. Cem Taşan, the POSCO Associate Professor of Metallurgy who is leading a J-WAFS Solutions commercialization team that is about to launch a startup company, sums it up by noting, “Without J-WAFS, we wouldn’t be here at all.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS looks to the future, its continued commitment — supported by the generosity of its donors and partners — builds on a decade of success enabling MIT faculty to advance water and food research that addresses some of the world’s most pressing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Haber-Bosch process, which converts atmospheric nitrogen to make ammonia fertilizer, revolutionized agriculture and helped feed the world’s growing population, but it also created huge environmental problems. It is one of the most energy-intensive chemical processes in the world, responsible for 1-2 percent of global energy consumption. It also releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that harms the ozone layer. Excess nitrogen also routinely runs off farms into waterways, harming marine life and polluting groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In place of synthetic fertilizer, Pivot Bio has engineered nitrogen-producing microbes to make farming more sustainable. The company, which was co-founded by Professor Chris Voigt, Karsten Temme, and Alvin Tamsir, has engineered its microbes to grow on plant roots, where they feed on the root’s sugars and precisely deliver nitrogen in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s microbial colonies grow with the plant and produce more nitrogen at exactly the time the plant needs it, minimizing nitrogen runoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way we have delivered nutrients to support plant growth historically is fertilizer, but that’s an inefficient way to get all the nutrients you need,” says Temme, Pivot’s chief innovation officer. “We have the ability now to help farmers be more efficient and productive with microbes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers can replace up to 40 pounds per acre of traditional nitrogen with Pivot’s product, which amounts to about a quarter of the total nitrogen needed for a crop like corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s products are already being used to grow corn, wheat, barley, oats, and other grains across millions of acres of American farmland, eliminating hundreds of thousands of tons of CO2 equivalent in the process. The company’s impact is even more striking given its unlikely origins, which trace back to one of the most challenging times of Voigt’s career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Pivot from despair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beginning of every faculty member’s career can be a sink-or-swim moment, and by Voigt’s own account, he was drowning. As a freshly minted assistant professor at the University of California at San Francisco, Voigt was struggling to stand up his lab, attract funding, and get experiments started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 2008, Voigt joined a research group out of the University of California at Berkeley that was writing a grant proposal focused on photovoltaic materials. His initial role was minor, but a senior researcher pulled out of the group a week before the proposal had to be submitted, so Voigt stepped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said ‘I’ll finish this section in a week,’” Voigt recalls. “It was my big chance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the proposal, Voigt detailed an ambitious plan to rearrange the genetics of biologic photosynthetic systems to make them more efficient. He barely submitted it in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months went by, then the proposal reviews finally came back. Voigt hurried to the meeting with some of the most senior researchers at UC Berkeley to discuss the responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My part of the proposal got completely slammed,” Voigt says. “There were something like 15 reviews on it — they were longer than the actual grant — and it’s just one after another tearing into my proposal. All the most famous people are in this meeting, future energy secretaries, future leaders of the university, and it was totally embarrassing. After that meeting, I was considering leaving academia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few discouraging months later, Voigt got a call from Paul Ludden, the dean of the School of Science at UC Berkeley. He wanted to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I walk into Paul’s office, he’s reading my proposal,” Voigt recalls. “He sits me down and says, ‘Everybody’s telling me how terrible this is.’ I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God.’ But then he says, ‘I think there’s something here. Your idea is good, you just picked the wrong system.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludden went on to explain to Voigt that he should apply his gene-swapping idea to nitrogen fixation. He even offered to send Voigt a postdoc from his lab, Dehua Zhao, to help. Voigt paired Zhao with Temme, and sure enough, the resulting 2011 paper of their work was well-received by the nitrogen fixation community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nitrogen fixation has been a holy grail for scientists, agronomists, and farmers for almost a century, ever since somebody discovered the first microbe that can fix nitrogen for legumes like soybeans,” Temme says. “Everybody always said that someday we'll be able to do this for the cereal crops. The excitement with Pivot was this is the first time that technology became accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voigt had moved to MIT in 2010. When the paper came out, he founded Pivot Bio with Temme and another Berkeley researcher, Alvin Tamsir. Since then, Voigt, who is the Daniel I.C. Wang Professor at MIT and the head of the Department of Biological Engineering, has continued collaborating with Pivot on things like increasing nitrogen production, making strains more stable, and making them inducible to different signals from the plant. Pivot has licensed technology from MIT, and the research has also received support from MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s first goals were to gain regulatory approval and prove themselves in the marketplace. To gain approval in the U.S., Pivot’s team focused on using DNA from within the same organism rather than bringing in totally new DNA, which simplified the approval process. It also partnered with independent corn seed dealers to get its product to farms. Early deployments occurred in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers apply Pivot’s product at planting, either as a liquid that gets sprayed on the soil or as a dry powder that is rehydrated and applied to the seeds as a coating. The microbes live on the surface of the growing root system, eating plant sugars and releasing nitrogen throughout the plant’s life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today, our microbes colonize just a fraction of the total sugars provided by the plant,” Temme explains. “They’re also sharing ammonia with the plant, and all of those things are just a portion of what’s possible technically. Our team is always trying to figure out how to make those microbes more efficient at getting the energy they need to grow or at fixing nitrogen and sharing it with the crop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Pivot started the N-Ovator program to connect companies with growers who practice sustainable farming using Pivot’s microbial nitrogen. Through the program, companies buy nitrogen credits and farmers can get paid by verifying their practices. The program was named one of the Inventions of the Year by &lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt; last year and has paid out millions of dollars to farmers to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial nitrogen and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot is currently selling to farmers across the U.S. and working with smallholder farmers in Kenya. It’s also hoping to gain approval for its microbial solution in Brazil and Canada, which it hopes will be its next markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do we get the economics to make sense for everybody — the farmers, our partners, and the company?” Temme says of Pivot’s mission. “Because this truly can be a deflationary technology that upends the very expensive traditional way of making fertilizer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s team is also extending the product to cotton, and Temme says microbes can be a nitrogen source for any type of plant on the planet. Further down the line, the company believes it can help farmers with other nutrients essential to help their crops grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we’ve established our technology, how can Pivot help farmers overcome all the other limitations they face with crop nutrients to maximize yields?” Temme asks. “That really starts to change the way a farmer thinks about managing the entire acre from a price, productivity, and sustainability perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Streamlining data collection for improved salmon population management</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sara Beery came to MIT as an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) eager to focus on ecological challenges. She has fashioned her research career around the opportunity to apply her expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and data science to tackle real-world issues in conservation and sustainability. Beery was drawn to the Institute’s commitment to “computing for the planet,” and set out to bring her methods to global-scale environmental and biodiversity monitoring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Pacific Northwest, salmon have a disproportionate impact on the health of their ecosystems, and their complex reproductive needs have attracted Beery’s attention. Each year, millions of salmon embark on a migration to spawn. Their journey begins in freshwater stream beds where the eggs hatch. Young salmon fry (newly hatched salmon) make their way to the ocean, where they spend several years maturing to adulthood. As adults, the salmon return to the streams where they were born in order to spawn, ensuring the continuation of their species by depositing their eggs in the gravel of the stream beds. Both male and female salmon die shortly after supplying the river habitat with the next generation of salmon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout their migration, salmon support a wide range of organisms in the ecosystems they pass through. For example, salmon bring nutrients like carbon and nitrogen from the ocean upriver, enhancing their availability to those ecosystems. In addition, salmon are key to many predator-prey relationships: They serve as a food source for various predators, such as bears, wolves, and birds, while helping to control other populations, like insects, through predation. After they die from spawning, the decomposing salmon carcasses also replenish valuable nutrients to the surrounding ecosystem. The migration of salmon not only sustains their own species but plays a critical role in the overall health of the rivers and oceans they inhabit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, salmon populations play an important role both economically and culturally in the region. Commercial and recreational salmon fisheries contribute significantly to the local economy. And for many Indigenous peoples in the Pacific northwest, salmon hold notable cultural value, as they have been central to their diets, traditions, and ceremonies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring salmon migration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increased human activity, including overfishing and hydropower development, together with habitat loss and climate change, have had a significant impact on salmon populations in the region. As a result, effective monitoring and management of salmon fisheries is important to ensure balance among competing ecological, cultural, and human interests. Accurately counting salmon during their seasonal migration to their natal river to spawn is essential in order to track threatened populations, assess the success of recovery strategies, guide fishing season regulations, and support the management of both commercial and recreational fisheries. Precise population data help decision-makers employ the best strategies to safeguard the health of the ecosystem while accommodating human needs. Monitoring salmon migration is a labor-intensive and inefficient undertaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beery is currently leading a research project that aims to streamline salmon monitoring using cutting-edge computer vision methods. This project fits within Beery’s broader research interest, which focuses on the interdisciplinary space between artificial intelligence, the natural world, and sustainability. Its relevance to fisheries management made it a good fit for funding from MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS). Beery’s 2023 J-WAFS seed grant was the first research funding she was awarded since joining the MIT faculty. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historically, monitoring efforts relied on humans to manually count salmon from riverbanks using eyesight. In the past few decades, underwater sonar systems have been implemented to aid in counting the salmon. These sonar systems are essentially underwater video cameras, but they differ in that they use acoustics instead of light sensors to capture the presence of a fish. Use of this method requires people to set up a tent alongside the river to count salmon based on the output of a sonar camera that is hooked up to a laptop. While this system is an improvement to the original method of monitoring salmon by eyesight, it still relies significantly on human effort and is an arduous and time-consuming process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Automating salmon monitoring is necessary for better management of salmon fisheries. “We need these technological tools,” says Beery. “We can’t keep up with the demand of monitoring and understanding and studying these really complex ecosystems that we work in without some form of automation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to automate counting of migrating salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest, the project team, including Justin Kay, a PhD student in EECS, has been collecting data in the form of videos from sonar cameras at different rivers. The team annotates a subset of the data to train the computer vision system to autonomously detect and count the fish as they migrate. Kay describes the process of how the model counts each migrating fish: “The computer vision algorithm is designed to locate a fish in the frame, draw a box around it, and then track it over time. If a fish is detected on one side of the screen and leaves on the other side of the screen, then we count it as moving upstream.” On rivers where the team has created training data for the system, it has produced strong results, with only 3 to 5 percent counting error. This is well below the target that the team and partnering stakeholders set of no more than a 10 percent counting error.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing and deployment: Balancing human effort and use of automation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers’ technology is being deployed to monitor the migration of salmon on the newly restored Klamath River. Four dams on the river were recently demolished, making it the largest dam removal project in U.S. history. The dams came down after a more than 20-year-long campaign to remove them, which was led by Klamath tribes, in collaboration with scientists, environmental organizations, and commercial fishermen. After the removal of the dams, 240 miles of the river now flow freely and nearly 800 square miles of habitat are accessible to salmon. Beery notes the almost immediate regeneration of salmon populations in the Klamath River: “I think it was within eight days of the dam coming down, they started seeing salmon actually migrate upriver beyond the dam.” In a collaboration with California Trout, the team is currently processing new data to adapt and create a customized model that can then be deployed to help count the newly migrating salmon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One challenge with the system revolves around training the model to accurately count the fish in unfamiliar environments with variations such as riverbed features, water clarity, and lighting conditions. These factors can significantly alter how the fish appear on the output of a sonar camera and confuse the computer model. When deployed in new rivers where no data have been collected before, like the Klamath, the performance of the system degrades and the margin of error increases substantially to 15-20 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers constructed an automatic adaptation algorithm within the system to overcome this challenge and create a scalable system that can be deployed to any site without human intervention. This self-initializing technology works to automatically calibrate to the new conditions and environment to accurately count the migrating fish. In testing, the automatic adaptation algorithm was able to reduce the counting error down to the 10 to 15 percent range. The improvement in counting error with the self-initializing function means that the technology is closer to being deployable to new locations without much additional human effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling real-time management with the “Fishbox”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another challenge faced by the research team was the development of an efficient data infrastructure. In order to run the computer vision system, the video produced by sonar cameras must be delivered via the cloud or by manually mailing hard drives from a river site to the lab. These methods have notable drawbacks: a cloud-based approach is limited due to lack of internet connectivity in remote river site locations, and shipping the data introduces problems of delay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of relying on these methods, the team has implemented a power-efficient computer, coined the “Fishbox,” that can be used in the field to perform the processing. The Fishbox consists of a small, lightweight computer with optimized software that fishery managers can plug into their existing laptops and sonar cameras. The system is then capable of running salmon counting models directly at the sonar sites without the need for internet connectivity. This allows managers to make hour-by-hour decisions, supporting more responsive, real-time management of salmon populations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team is also working to bring a community together around monitoring for salmon fisheries management in the Pacific Northwest. “It’s just pretty exciting to have stakeholders who are enthusiastic about getting access to [our technology] as we get it to work and having a tighter integration and collaboration with them,” says Beery. “I think particularly when you’re working on food and water systems, you need direct collaboration to help facilitate impact, because you're ensuring that what you develop is actually serving the needs of the people and organizations that you are helping to support.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This past June, Beery’s lab organized a workshop in Seattle that convened nongovernmental organizations, tribes, and state and federal departments of fish and wildlife to discuss the use of automated sonar systems to monitor and manage salmon populations. Kay notes that the workshop was an “awesome opportunity to have everybody sharing different ways that they're using sonar and thinking about how the automated methods that we’re building could fit into that workflow.” The discussion continues now via a shared Slack channel created by the team, with over 50 participants. Convening this group is a significant achievement, as many of these organizations would not otherwise have had an opportunity to come together and collaborate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team continues to tune the computer vision system, refine their technology, and engage with diverse stakeholders — from Indigenous communities to fishery managers — the project is poised to make significant improvements to the efficiency and accuracy of salmon monitoring and management in the region. And as Beery advances the work of her MIT group, the J-WAFS seed grant is helping to keep challenges such as fisheries management in her sights. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that the J-WAFS seed grant existed here at MIT enabled us to continue to work on this project when we moved here,” comments Beery, adding “it also expanded the scope of the project and allowed us to maintain active collaboration on what I think is a really important and impactful project.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS marks its 10th anniversary this year, the program aims to continue supporting and encouraging MIT faculty to pursue innovative projects that aim to advance knowledge and create practical solutions with real-world impacts on global water and food system challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Andrew Babbin tries to pack light for work trips. Along with the travel essentials, though, he also brings&amp;nbsp;a roll each of electrical tape, duct tape, lab tape, a pack of cable ties, and some bungee cords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s my MacGyver kit: You never know when you have to rig something on the fly in the field or fix a broken bag,” Babbin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trips Babbin takes are far out to sea, on month-long cruises, where he works to sample waters off the Pacific coast and out in the open ocean. In remote locations, repair essentials often come in handy, as when Babbin had to zip-tie a wrench to a sampling device to help it sink through an icy Antarctic lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babbin is an oceanographer and marine biogeochemist who studies marine microbes and the ways in which they control the cycling of nitrogen between the ocean and the atmosphere. This exchange helps maintain healthy ocean ecosystems and supports the ocean’s capacity to store carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining measurements that he takes in the ocean with experiments in his MIT lab, Babbin is working to understand the connections between microbes and ocean nitrogen, which could in turn help scientists identify ways to maintain the ocean’s health and productivity. His work has taken him to many coastal and open-ocean regions around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You really become an oceanographer and an Earth scientist to see the world,” says Babbin, who&amp;nbsp;recently earned tenure as&amp;nbsp;the Cecil and Ida Green Career Development Professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. “We embrace the diversity of places and cultures on this planet. To see just a small fraction of that is special.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A powerful cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ocean has been a constant presence for Babbin since childhood. His family is from Monmouth County, New Jersey, where he and his twin sister grew up playing along the Jersey shore. When they were teenagers, their parents took the kids on family cruise vacations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always loved being on the water,” he says. “My favorite parts of any of those cruises were the days at sea, where you were just in the middle of some ocean basin with water all around you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In school, Babbin gravitated to the sciences, and chemistry in particular. After high school, he attended Columbia University, where a visit to the school’s Earth and environmental engineering department catalyzed a realization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, it was always this excitement about the water and about chemistry, and it was this pop of, ‘Oh wow, it doesn’t have to be one or the other,’” Babbin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He chose to major in Earth and environmental engineering, with a concentration in water resources and climate risks. After graduating in 2008, Babbin returned to his home state, where he attended Princeton University and set a course for a PhD in geosciences, with a focus on chemical oceanography and environmental microbiology. His advisor, oceanographer Bess Ward, took Babbin on as a member of her research group and invited him on several month-long cruises to various parts of the eastern tropical Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I still remember that first trip,” Babbin recalls. “It was a whirlwind. Everyone else had been to sea a gazillion times and was loading the boat and strapping things down, and I had no idea of anything. And within a few hours, I was doing an experiment as the ship rocked back and forth!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babbin learned to deploy sampling cannisters overboard, then haul them back up and analyze the seawater inside for signs of nitrogen — an essential nutrient for all living things on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the plants and animals that depend on nitrogen to survive are unable to take it up from the atmosphere themselves. They require a sort of go-between, in the form of microbes that “fix” nitrogen, converting it from nitrogen gas to more digestible forms. In the ocean, this nitrogen fixation is done by highly specialized microbial species, which work to make nitrogen available to phytoplankton — microscopic plant-like organisms that are the foundation of the marine food chain. Phytoplankton are also a main route by which the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microorganisms may also use these biologically available forms of nitrogen for energy under certain conditions, returning nitrogen to the atmosphere. These microbes can also release a byproduct of nitrous oxide, which is a potent greenhouse gas that also can catalyze ozone loss in the stratosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through his graduate work, at sea and in the lab, Babbin became fascinated with the cycling of nitrogen and the role that nitrogen-fixing microbes play in supporting the ocean’s ecosystems and the climate overall. A balance of nitrogen inputs and outputs sustains phytoplankton and maintains the ocean’s ability to soak up carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of the really pressing questions in ocean biogeochemistry pertain to this cycling of nitrogen,” Babbin says. “Understanding the ways in which this one element cycles through the ocean, and how it is central to ecosystem health and the planet’s climate, has been really powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the lab and out to sea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing his PhD in 2014, Babbin arrived at MIT as a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My first feeling when I came here was, wow, this really is a nerd’s playground,” Babbin says. “I embraced being part of a culture where we seek to understand the world better, while also doing the things we really want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, he accepted a faculty position in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. He set up his laboratory space, painted in his favorite brilliant orange, on the top floor of the Green Building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His group uses 3D printers to fabricate microfluidic devices in which they reproduce the conditions of the ocean environment and study microbe metabolism and its effects on marine chemistry. In the field, Babbin has led research expeditions to the Galapagos Islands and parts of the eastern Pacific, where he has collected and analyzed samples of air and water for signs of nitrogen transformations and microbial activity. His new measuring station in the Galapagos is able to infer marine emissions of nitrous oxide across a large swath of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. His group has also sailed to southern Cuba, where the researchers studied interactions of microbes in coral reefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Babbin traveled to Antarctica, where he set up camp next to frozen lakes and plumbed for samples of pristine ice water that he will analyze for genetic remnants of ancient microbes. Such preserved bacterial DNA could help scientists understand how microbes evolved and influenced the Earth’s climate over billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microbes are the terraformers,” Babbin notes. “They have been, since life evolved more than 3 billion years ago. We have to think about how they shape the natural world and how they will respond to the Anthropocene as humans monkey with the planet ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collective action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babbin is now charting new research directions. In addition to his work at sea and in the lab, he is venturing into engineering, with a new project to design denitrifying capsules. While nitrogen is an essential nutrient for maintaining a marine ecosystem, too much nitrogen, such as from fertilizer that runs off into lakes and streams, can generate blooms of toxic algae. Babbin is looking to design eco-friendly capsules that scrub excess anthropogenic nitrogen from local waterways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s also beginning the process of designing a new sensor to measure low-oxygen concentrations in the ocean. As the planet warms, the oceans are losing oxygen, creating “dead zones” where fish cannot survive. While others including Babbin have tried to map these oxygen minimum zones, or OMZs, they have done so sporadically, by dropping sensors into the ocean over limited range, depth, and times. Babbin’s sensors could potentially provide a more complete map of OMZs, as they would be deployed on wide-ranging, deep-diving, and naturally propulsive vehicles: sharks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to measure oxygen. Sharks need oxygen. And if you look at where the sharks don’t go, you might have a sense of where the oxygen is not,” says Babbin, who is working with marine biologists on ways to tag sharks with oxygen sensors. “A number of these large pelagic fish move up and down the water column frequently, so you can map the depth to which they dive to, and infer something about the behavior. And my suggestion is, you might also infer something about the ocean’s chemistry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he reflects on what stimulates new ideas and research directions, Babbin credits working with others, in his own group and across MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My best thoughts come from this collective action,” Babbin says. “Particularly because we all have different upbringings and approach things from a different perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s bringing this collaborative spirit to his new role, as a mission director for MIT’s Climate Project. Along with Jesse Kroll, who is a professor of civil and environmental engineering and of chemical engineering, Babbin co-leads one of the project’s six missions: Restoring the Atmosphere, Protecting the Land and Oceans. Babbin and Kroll are planning a number of workshops across campus that they hope will generate new connections, and spark new ideas, particularly around ways to evaluate the effectiveness of different climate mitigation strategies and better assess the impacts of climate on society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One area we want to promote is thinking of climate science and climate interventions as two sides of the same coin,” Babbin says. “There’s so much action that’s trying to be catalyzed. But we want it to be the best action. Because we really have one shot at doing this. Time is of the essence.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to water use, most of us think of the water we drink. But industrial uses for things like manufacturing account for billions of gallons of water each day. For instance, making a single iPhone, by &lt;a href="https://watercalculator.org/footprint/the-hidden-water-in-everyday-products/#:~:text=When%20the%20water%20required%20for,is%20an%20estimated%203%2C190%20gallons."&gt;one estimate&lt;/a&gt;, requires more than 3,000 gallons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gradiant is working to reduce the world’s industrial water footprint. Founded by a team from MIT, Gradiant offers water recycling, treatment, and purification solutions to some of the largest companies on Earth, including Coca Cola, Tesla, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. By serving as an end-to-end water company, Gradiant says it helps companies reuse 2 billion gallons of water&amp;nbsp;each day and saves another 2 billion gallons&amp;nbsp;of fresh water from being withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s mission is to preserve water for generations to come in the face of rising global demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We work on both ends of the water spectrum,” Gradiant co-founder and CEO Anurag Bajpayee SM ’08, PhD ’12 says. “We work with ultracontaminated water, and we can also provide ultrapure water for use in areas like chip fabrication. Our specialty is in the extreme water challenges that can’t be solved with traditional technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each customer, Gradiant builds tailored water treatment solutions that combine chemical treatments with membrane filtration and biological process technologies, leveraging a portfolio of patents to drastically cut water usage and waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before Gradiant, 40 million liters of water would be used in the chip-making process. It would all be contaminated and treated, and maybe 30 percent would be reused,” explains Gradiant co-founder and COO Prakash Govindan PhD ’12. “We have the technology to recycle, in some cases, 99 percent of the water. Now, instead of consuming 40 million liters, chipmakers only need to consume 400,000 liters, which is a huge shift in the water footprint of that industry. And this is not just with semiconductors. We’ve done this in food and beverage, we’ve done this in renewable energy, we’ve done this in pharmaceutical drug production, and several other areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning the value of water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Govindan grew up in a part of India that experienced a years-long drought beginning when he was 10. Without tap water, one of Govindan’s chores was to haul water up the stairs of his apartment complex each time a truck delivered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However much water my brother and I could carry was how much we had for the week,” Govindan recalls. “I learned the value of water the hard way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Govindan attended the Indian Institute of Technology as an undergraduate, and when he came to MIT for his PhD, he sought out the groups working on water challenges. He began working on a water treatment method called carrier gas extraction for his PhD under Gradiant co-founder and MIT Professor John Lienhard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bajpayee also worked on water treatment methods at MIT, and the pair worked with the Deshpande Center to derisk their technologies. After brief stints as postdocs at MIT, the researchers licensed their work and founded Gradiant in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrier gas extraction became Gradiant’s first proprietary technology. The founders began by treating wastewater created by oil and gas wells, landing their first partner in a Texas company. But Gradiant gradually expanded to solving water challenges in power generation, mining, textiles, and refineries. Then the founders noticed opportunities in industries like electronics, semiconductors, food and beverage, and pharmaceuticals. Today, oil and gas wastewater treatment makes up a small percentage of Gradiant’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the company expanded, it added technologies to its portfolio, patenting new water treatment methods around reverse osmosis, selective contaminant extraction, and free radical oxidation. Gradiant has also created a digital system that uses AI to measure, predict, and control water treatment facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The advantage Gradiant has over every other water company is that R&amp;amp;D is in our DNA,” Govindan says, noting Gradiant has a world-class research lab at its headquarters in Boston. “At MIT, we learned how to do cutting-edge technology development, and we never let go of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders compare their suite of technologies to LEGO bricks they can mix and match depending on a customer’s water needs. Gradiant has built more than 2,500 of these end-to-end systems for customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our customers aren’t water companies; they are industrial clients like semiconductor manufacturers, drug companies, and food and beverage companies,” Bajpayee says. “They aren’t about to start operating a water treatment plant. They look at us as their water partner who can take care of the whole water problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders say Gradiant has been roughly doubling its revenue each year over the last five years, and it’s continuing to add technologies to its platform. For instance, Gradiant recently developed a critical minerals recovery solution to extract materials like lithium and nickel from customers’ wastewater, which could expand access to critical materials essential to the production of batteries and other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can extract lithium from brine water in an environmentally and economically feasible way, the U.S. can meet all of its lithium needs from within the U.S.,” Bajpayee says. “What’s preventing large-scale extraction of lithium from brine is technology, and we believe what we have now deployed will open the floodgates for direct lithium extraction and completely revolutionized the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also validated a method for eliminating PFAS —&amp;nbsp;so-called toxic “forever chemicals” — in a pilot project with a leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturer.&amp;nbsp;In the near future, it hopes to bring that solution to municipal water treatment plants to protect cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Gradiant’s innovation is the founders’ belief that industrial activity doesn’t have to deplete one of the world’s most vital resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ever since the industrial revolution, we’ve been taking from nature,” Bajpayee says. “By treating and recycling water, by reducing water consumption and making industry highly water efficient, we have this unique opportunity to turn the clock back and give nature water back. If that’s your driver, you can’t choose not to innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Explained: Generative AI’s environmental impact</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Rapid development and deployment of powerful generative AI models comes with environmental consequences, including increased electricity demand and water consumption.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a two-part series,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; explores the environmental implications of generative AI. In this article, we look at why this technology is so resource-intensive. A second piece will investigate what experts are doing to reduce genAI’s carbon footprint and other impacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excitement surrounding potential benefits of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/explained-generative-ai-1109" target="_blank"&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt;, from improving worker productivity to advancing scientific research, is hard to ignore. While the explosive growth of this new technology has enabled rapid deployment of powerful models in many industries, the environmental consequences of this generative AI “gold rush” remain difficult to pin down, let alone mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computational power required to train generative AI models that often have billions of parameters, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, can demand a staggering amount of electricity, which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions and pressures on the electric grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, deploying these models in real-world applications, enabling millions to use generative AI in their daily lives, and then fine-tuning the models to improve their performance draws large amounts of energy long after a model has been developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond electricity demands, a great deal of water is needed to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems. The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we think about the environmental impact of generative AI, it is not just the electricity you consume when you plug the computer in. There are much broader consequences that go out to a system level and persist based on actions that we take,” says Elsa A. Olivetti, professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the lead of the Decarbonization Mission of MIT’s new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://climateproject.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Climate Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olivetti is senior author of a 2024 paper, “&lt;a href="https://mit-genai.pubpub.org/pub/8ulgrckc/release/2" target="_blank"&gt;The Climate and Sustainability Implications of Generative AI&lt;/a&gt;,” co-authored by MIT colleagues in response to an Institute-wide call for papers that explore the transformative potential of generative AI, in both positive and negative directions for society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demanding data centers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electricity demands of data centers are one major factor contributing to the environmental impacts of generative AI, since data centers are used to train and run the deep learning models behind popular tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A data center is a temperature-controlled building that houses computing infrastructure, such as servers, data storage drives, and network equipment. For instance, Amazon has more than&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/" target="_blank"&gt;100 data centers worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, each of which has about 50,000 servers that the company uses to support cloud computing services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While data centers have been around since the 1940s (the first was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1945 to support the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/about/history-heritage/eniac/" target="_blank"&gt;first general-purpose digital computer&lt;/a&gt;, the ENIAC), the rise of generative AI has dramatically increased the pace of data center construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is different about generative AI is the power density it requires. Fundamentally, it is just computing, but a generative AI training cluster might consume seven or eight times more energy than a typical computing workload,” says Noman Bashir, lead author of the impact paper, who is a Computing and Climate Impact Fellow at MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium (MCSC) and a postdoc in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have estimated that the power requirements of data centers in North America increased from 2,688 megawatts at the end of 2022 to 5,341 megawatts at the end of 2023, partly driven by the demands of generative AI. Globally, the electricity consumption of data centers rose to 460 terawatts in 2022. This would have made data centers the 11th largest electricity consumer in the world, between the nations of Saudi Arabia (371 terawatts) and France (463 terawatts), according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2026, the electricity consumption of data centers is expected to approach 1,050 terawatts (which would bump data centers up to fifth place on the global list, between Japan and Russia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not all data center computation involves generative AI, the technology has been a major driver of increasing energy demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The demand for new data centers cannot be met in a sustainable way. The pace at which companies are building new data centers means the bulk of the electricity to power them must come from fossil fuel-based power plants,” says Bashir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power needed to train and deploy a model like OpenAI’s GPT-3 is difficult to ascertain. In a 2021 research paper, scientists from Google and the University of California at Berkeley estimated the training process alone consumed 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity (enough to power about 120 average U.S. homes for a year), generating about 552 tons of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all machine-learning models must be trained, one issue unique to generative AI is the rapid fluctuations in energy use that occur over different phases of the training process, Bashir explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power grid operators must have a way to absorb those fluctuations to protect the grid, and they usually employ&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nrg.com/insights/energy-education/generation.html#:~:text=Peaking%20power,-When%20demand%20increases&amp;amp;text=Most%20often%20these%20peaks%20occur,basis%20to%20ensure%20system%20reliability." target="_blank"&gt;diesel-based generators&lt;/a&gt; for that task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing impacts from inference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a generative AI model is trained, the energy demands don’t disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time a model is used, perhaps by an individual asking ChatGPT to summarize an email, the computing hardware that performs those operations consumes energy. Researchers have estimated that a ChatGPT query consumes about five times more electricity than a simple web search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But an everyday user doesn’t think too much about that,” says Bashir. “The ease-of-use of generative AI interfaces and the lack of information about the environmental impacts of my actions means that, as a user, I don’t have much incentive to cut back on my use of generative AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With traditional AI, the energy usage is split fairly evenly between data processing, model training, and inference, which is the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data. However, Bashir expects the electricity demands of generative AI inference to eventually dominate since these models are becoming ubiquitous in so many applications, and the electricity needed for inference will increase as future versions of the models become larger and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, generative AI models have an especially short shelf-life, driven by rising demand for new AI applications. Companies release new models every few weeks, so the energy used to train prior versions goes to waste, Bashir adds. New models often consume more energy for training, since they usually have more parameters than their predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While electricity demands of data centers may be getting the most attention in research literature, the amount of water consumed by these facilities has environmental impacts, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chilled water is used to cool a data center by absorbing heat from computing equipment. It has been estimated that, for each kilowatt hour of energy a data center consumes, it would need two liters of water for cooling, says Bashir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because this is called ‘cloud computing’ doesn’t mean the hardware lives in the cloud. Data centers are present in our physical world, and because of their water usage they have direct and indirect implications for biodiversity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computing hardware inside data centers brings its own, less direct environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is difficult to estimate how much power is needed to manufacture a GPU, a type of powerful processor that can handle intensive generative AI workloads, it would be more than what is needed to produce a simpler CPU because the fabrication process is more complex. A GPU’s carbon footprint is compounded by the emissions related to material and product transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also environmental implications of obtaining the raw materials used to fabricate GPUs, which can involve dirty mining procedures and the use of toxic chemicals for processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market research firm TechInsights estimates that the three major producers (NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel) shipped 3.85 million GPUs to data centers in 2023, up from about 2.67 million in 2022. That number is expected to have increased by an even greater percentage in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is on an unsustainable path, but there are ways to encourage responsible development of generative AI that supports environmental objectives, Bashir says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He, Olivetti, and their MIT colleagues argue that this will require a comprehensive consideration of all the environmental and societal costs of generative AI, as well as a detailed assessment of the value in its perceived benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need a more contextual way of systematically and comprehensively understanding the implications of new developments in this space. Due to the speed at which there have been improvements, we haven’t had a chance to catch up with our abilities to measure and understand the tradeoffs,” Olivetti says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Elaine Jutamulia ’24 took a sip of coffee with a few drops of anise extract. It was her second try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What do you think?” asked Omar Orozco, standing at a lab table in MIT’s Breakerspace, surrounded by filters, brewing pots, and other coffee paraphernalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think when I first tried it, it was still pretty bitter,”&amp;nbsp;Jutamulia said thoughtfully. “But I think now that it’s steeped for a little bit — it took out some of the bitterness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jutamulia and current MIT senior Orozco were part of class 3.000 (Coffee Matters: Using the Breakerspace to Make the Perfect Cup), a new MIT course that debuted in spring 2024. The class combines lectures on chemistry and the science of coffee with hands-on experimentation and group projects. Their project explored how additives such as anise, salt, and chili oil influence coffee extraction — the process of dissolving flavor compounds from ground coffee into water — to improve taste and correct common brewing errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside tasting, they used an infrared spectrometer to identify the chemical compounds in their coffee samples that contribute to flavor. Does anise make bitter coffee smoother? Could chili oil balance the taste?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally speaking, if we could make a recommendation, that’s what we’re trying to find,” Orozco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-unit “discovery class” designed to help first-year students explore majors, 3.000 was widely popular, enrolling more than 50 students. Its success was driven by the beverage at its core and the class’s hands-on approach, which pushes students to ask and answer questions they might not have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For aeronautics and astronautics majors Gabi McDonald and McKenzie Dinesen, coffee was the draw, but the class encouraged them to experiment and think in new ways. “It’s easy to drop people like us in, who love coffee, and, ‘Oh my gosh, there’s this class where we can go make coffee half the time and try all different kinds of things?’” McDonald says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percolating knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class pairs weekly lectures on topics such as coffee chemistry, the anatomy and composition of a coffee bean, the effects of roasting, and the brewing process with tasting sessions — students sample coffee brewed from different beans, roasts, and grinds. In the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/breakerspace-illuminates-mysteries-materials-1208" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Breakerspace&lt;/a&gt;, a new space on campus conceived and managed by the Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE), students use equipment such as a digital optical microscope to examine ground coffee particles and a scanning electron microscope, which shoots beams of electrons at samples to reveal cross-sections of beans in stunning detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once students learn to operate instruments for guided tasks, they form groups and design their own projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The driver for those projects is some question they have about coffee raised by one of the lectures or the tasting sessions, or just something they’ve always wanted to know,” says DMSE Professor Jeffrey Grossman, who designed and teaches the class. “Then they’ll use one or more of these pieces of equipment to shed some light on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grossman traces the origins of the class to his initial vision for the Breakerspace, a laboratory for materials analysis and lounge for MIT undergraduates. Opened in November 2023, the space gives students hands-on experience with materials science and engineering, an interdisciplinary field combining chemistry, physics, and engineering to probe the composition and structure of materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The world is made of stuff, and these are the tools to understand that stuff and bring it to life,” says Grossman. So he envisioned a class that would give students an “exploratory, inspiring nudge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then the question wasn’t the pedagogy, it was, ‘What’s the hook?’ In materials science, there are a lot of directions you could go, but if you have one that inspires people because they know it and maybe like it already, then that’s exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cup of ambition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hook, of course, was coffee, the second-most-consumed beverage after water. It captured students’ imagination and motivated them to push boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orozco brought a fair amount of coffee knowledge to the class. In 2023, he taught in Mexico through the MISTI Global Teaching Labs program, where he toured several coffee farms and acquired a deeper knowledge of the beverage. He learned, for example, that black coffee, contrary to general American opinion, isn’t naturally bitter; bitterness arises from certain compounds that develop during the roasting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you properly brew it with the right beans, it actually tastes good,” says Orozco, a humanities and engineering major. A year later, in 3.000, he expanded his understanding of making a good brew, particularly through the group project with Jutamulia and other students to fix bad coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group prepared a control sample of “perfectly brewed” coffee — based on taste, coffee-to-water ratio, and other standards covered in class — alongside coffee that was under-extracted and over-extracted. Under-extracted coffee, made with water that isn’t hot enough or brewed for too short a time, tastes sharp or sour. Over-extracted coffee, brewed with too much coffee or for too long, tastes bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those coffee samples got additives and were analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, measuring how coffee absorbed infrared light to identify flavor-related compounds. Jutamulia examined FTIR readings taken from a sample with lime juice to see how the citric acid influenced its chemical profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can we find any correlation between what we saw and the existing known measurements of citric acid?” asks Jutamulia, who studied computation and cognition at MIT, graduating last May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another group dove into coffee storage, questioning why conventional wisdom advises against freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just wondered why that’s the case,” says electrical engineering and computer science major Noah Wiley, a coffee enthusiast with his own espresso machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared methods like freezing brewed coffee, frozen coffee grounds, and whole beans ground after freezing, evaluating their impact on flavor and chemical composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then we’re going to see which ones taste good,” says Wiley. The team used a class coffee review sheet to record attributes like acidity, bitterness, sweetness, and overall flavor, pairing the results with FTIR analysis to determine how storage affected taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wiley acknowledged that “good” is subjective. “Sometimes there’s a group consensus. I think people like fuller coffee, not watery,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other student projects compared caffeine levels in different coffee types, analyzed the effect of microwaving coffee on its chemical composition and flavor, and investigated the differences between authentic and counterfeit coffee beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We gave the students some papers to look at in case they were interested,” says Justin Lavallee, Breakerspace manager and co-teacher of the class. “But mostly we told them to focus on something they wanted to learn more about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drip, drip, drip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond answering specific questions about coffee, both students and teachers gained deeper insights into the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee is a complicated material. There are thousands of molecules in the beans, which change as you roast and extract them,” says Grossman. “The number of ways you can engineer this collection of molecules — it’s profound, ranging from where and how the coffee’s grown to how the cherries are then treated to get the beans to how the beans are roasted and ground to the brewing method you use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dinesen learned firsthand, discovering, for example, that darker roasts have less caffeine than lighter roasts, puncturing a common misconception. “You can vary coffee so much — just with the roast of the bean, the size of the ground,” she says. “It’s so easily manipulatable, if that's a word.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to learning about the science and chemistry behind coffee, Dinesen and McDonald gained new brewing techniques, like using a pour-over cone. The pair even incorporated coffee making and testing into their study routine, brewing coffee while tackling problem sets for another class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would put my pour-over cone in my backpack with a Ziploc bag full of grounds, and we would go to the Student Center and pull out the cone, a filter, and the coffee grounds,” McDonald says. “And then we would make pour-overs while doing a P-set. We tested different amounts of water, too. It was fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Chen, a materials science and engineering major, reflected on the 3.000’s title — “Using the Breakerspace to Make the Perfect Cup” — and whether making a perfect cup is possible. “I don’t think there’s one perfect cup because each person has their own preferences. I don't think I’ve gotten to mine yet,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm for coffee’s complexity and the discovery process was exactly what Grossman hoped to inspire in his students. “The best part for me was also just seeing them developing their own sense of curiosity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recalled a moment early in the class when students, after being given a demo of the optical microscope, saw the surface texture of a magnified coffee bean, the mottled shades of color, and the honeycomb-like pattern of tiny irregular cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re like, ‘Wait a second. What if we add hot water to the grounds while it’s under the microscope? Would we see the extraction?’ So, they got hot water and some ground coffee beans, and lo and behold, it looked different. They could see the extraction right there,” Grossman says. “It’s like they have an idea that’s inspired by the learning, and they go and try it. I saw that happen many, many times throughout the semester.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are an environmental hazard found nearly everywhere on Earth, released by the breakdown of tires, clothing, and plastic packaging. Another significant source of microplastics is tiny beads that are added to some cleansers, cosmetics, and other beauty products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to cut off some of these microplastics at their source, MIT researchers have developed a class of biodegradable materials that could replace the plastic beads now used in beauty products. These polymers break down into harmless sugars and amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One way to mitigate the microplastics problem is to figure out how to clean up existing pollution. But it’s equally important to look ahead and focus on creating materials that won’t generate microplastics in the first place,” says Ana Jaklenec,&amp;nbsp;a principal investigator at MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These particles could also find other applications. In the new study, Jaklenec and her colleagues showed that the particles could be used to encapsulate nutrients such as vitamin A. Fortifying foods with encapsulated vitamin A and other nutrients could help some of the 2 billion people around the world who suffer from nutrient deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaklenec and Robert Langer, an MIT Institute Professor and member of the Koch Institute, are the senior authors of the paper, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-024-00151-0" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Chemical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper’s lead author is Linzixuan (Rhoda) Zhang, an MIT graduate student in chemical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biodegradable plastics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Jaklenec, Langer, and others reported a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/microparticles-fight-malnutrition-1113" target="_blank"&gt;polymer material&lt;/a&gt; that they showed could be used to encapsulate vitamin A and other essential nutrients. They also found that people who consumed bread made from flour fortified with encapsulated iron showed increased iron levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the polymer, known as BMC, is a nondegradable polymer. As a result, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which funded the original research,&amp;nbsp;asked the MIT team if they could design an alternative that would be more environmentally friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Zhang, turned to a type of polymer that Langer’s lab had previously developed, known as poly(beta-amino esters). These polymers, which have shown promise as vehicles for gene delivery and other medical applications, are biodegradable and break down into sugars and amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By changing the composition of the material’s building blocks, researchers can tune properties such as hydrophobicity (ability to repel water), mechanical strength, and pH sensitivity. After creating five different candidate materials, the MIT team tested them and identified one that appeared to have the optimal composition for microplastic applications, including the ability to dissolve when exposed to acidic environments such as the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that they could use these particles to encapsulate vitamin A, as well as vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin C, zinc, and iron. Many of these nutrients are susceptible to heat and light degradation, but when encased in the particles, the researchers found that the nutrients could withstand exposure to boiling water for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also showed that even after being stored for six months at high temperature and high humidity, more than half of the encapsulated vitamins were undamaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate their potential for fortifying food, the researchers incorporated the particles into bouillon cubes, which are commonly consumed in many African countries. They found that when incorporated into bouillon, the nutrients remained intact after being boiled for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bouillon is a staple ingredient in sub-Saharan Africa, and offers a significant opportunity to improve the nutritional status of many billions of people in those regions,” Jaklenec says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers also tested the particles’ safety by exposing them to cultured human intestinal cells and measuring their effects on the cells. At the doses that would be used for food fortification, they found no damage to the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better cleansing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the particles’ ability to replace the microbeads that are often added to cleansers, the researchers mixed the particles with soap foam. This mixture, they found, could remove permanent marker and waterproof eyeliner from skin much more effectively than soap alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soap mixed with the new microplastic was also more effective than a cleanser that includes polyethylene microbeads, the researchers found. They also discovered that the new biodegradable particles did a better job of absorbing potentially toxic elements such as heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to use this as a first step to demonstrate how it’s possible to develop a new class of materials, to expand from existing material categories, and then to apply it to different applications,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a grant from Estée Lauder, the researchers are now working on further testing the microbeads as a cleanser and potentially other applications, and they plan to run a small human trial later this year. They are also gathering safety data that could be used to apply for GRAS (generally regarded as safe) classification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are planning a clinical trial of foods fortified with the particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope their work could help to significantly reduce the amount of microplastic released into the environment from health and beauty products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is just one small part of the broader microplastics issue, but as a society we’re beginning to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem. This work offers a step forward in addressing it,” Jaklenec says. “Polymers are incredibly useful and essential in countless applications in our daily lives, but they come with downsides. This is an example of how we can reduce some of those negative aspects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Gates Foundation and the U.S. National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Liquid on Mars was not necessarily all water</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dry river channels and lake beds on Mars point to the long-ago presence of a liquid on the planet's surface, and the minerals observed from orbit and from landers seem to many to prove that the liquid was ordinary water.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Not so fast, the authors of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-024-01576-1" target="_blank"&gt;a new Perspectives article in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nature Geoscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest. Water is only one of two possible liquids under what are thought to be the conditions present on ancient Mars. The other is liquid carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and it may actually have been easier for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere to condense into a liquid under those conditions than for water ice to melt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While others have suggested that liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) might be the source of some of the river channels seen on Mars, the mineral evidence has seemed to point uniquely to water. However, the new paper cites recent studies of carbon sequestration, the process of burying liquefied CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recovered from Earth’s atmosphere deep in underground caverns, which show that similar mineral alteration can occur in liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as in water, sometimes even more rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The new paper is led by Michael Hecht, principal investigator of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance/perseverance-rover/nasas-oxygen-generating-experiment-moxie-completes-mars-mission/"&gt;MOXIE instrument&lt;/a&gt; aboard the NASA Mars Rover Perseverance. Hecht, a research scientist at MIT's &lt;a href="https://www.haystack.mit.edu"&gt;Haystack Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and a former associate director, says, “Understanding how sufficient liquid water was able to flow on early Mars to explain the morphology and mineralogy we see today is probably the greatest unsettled question of Mars science. There is likely no one right answer, and we are merely suggesting another possible piece of the puzzle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the paper, the authors discuss the compatibility of their proposal with current knowledge of Martian atmospheric content and implications for Mars surface mineralogy. They also explore the latest carbon sequestration research and conclude that “LCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–mineral reactions are consistent with the predominant Mars alteration products: carbonates, phyllosilicates, and sulfates.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The argument for the probable existence of liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the Martian surface is not an all-or-nothing scenario; either liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, liquid water, or a combination may have brought about such geomorphological and mineralogical evidence for a liquid Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Three plausible cases for liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the Martian surface are proposed and discussed: stable surface liquid, basal melting under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ice, and subsurface reservoirs. The likelihood of each depends on the actual inventory of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the time, as well as the temperature conditions on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The authors acknowledge that the tested sequestration conditions, where the liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is above room temperature at pressures of tens of atmospheres, are very different from the cold, relatively low-pressure conditions that might have produced liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;on early Mars. They call for further laboratory investigations under more realistic conditions&amp;nbsp;to test whether the same chemical reactions occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hecht explains, “It’s difficult to say how likely it is that this speculation about early Mars is actually true. What we can say, and we are saying, is that the likelihood is high enough that the possibility should not be ignored.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>An inflatable gastric balloon could help people lose weight</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gastric balloons — silicone balloons filled with air or saline and placed in the stomach — can help people lose weight by making them feel too full to overeat. However, this effect eventually can wear off as the stomach becomes used to the sensation of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome that limitation, MIT engineers have designed a new type of gastric balloon that can be inflated and deflated as needed. In an animal study, they showed that inflating the balloon before a meal caused the animals to reduce their food intake by 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of intervention could offer an alternative for people who don’t want to undergo more invasive treatments such as gastric bypass surgery, or people who don’t respond well to weight-loss drugs, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The basic concept is we can have this balloon that is dynamic, so it would be inflated right before a meal and then you wouldn’t feel hungry. Then it would be deflated in between meals,” says Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Zixun Jia, who received a PhD from MIT in 2023, is the lead author of the paper, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.device.2024.100624" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Device&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An inflatable balloon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastric balloons filled with saline are currently approved for use in the United States. These balloons stimulate a sense of fullness in the stomach, and studies have shown that they work well, but the benefits are often temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gastric balloons do work initially. Historically, what has been seen is that the balloon is associated with weight loss. But then in general, the weight gain resumes the same trajectory,” Traverso says. “What we reasoned was perhaps if we had a system that simulates that fullness in a transient way, meaning right before a meal, that could be a way of inducing weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve a longer-lasting effect in patients, the researchers set out to design a device that could expand and contract on demand. They created two prototypes: One is a traditional balloon that inflates and deflates, and the other is a mechanical device with four arms that expand outward, pushing out an elastic polymer shell that presses on the stomach wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal tests,&amp;nbsp;the researchers found that the mechanical-arm device could effectively expand to fill the stomach, but they ended up deciding to pursue the balloon option instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our sense was that the balloon probably distributed the force better, and down the line, if you have balloon that is applying the pressure, that is probably a safer approach in the long run,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ new balloon is similar to a traditional gastric balloon, but it is inserted into the stomach through an incision in the abdominal wall. The balloon is connected to an external controller that can be attached to the skin and contains a pump that inflates and deflates the balloon when needed. Inserting this device would be similar to the procedure used to place a feeding tube into a patient’s stomach, which is commonly done for people who are unable to eat or drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If people, for example, are unable to swallow, they receive food through a tube like this. We know that we can keep tubes in for years, so there is already precedent for other systems that can stay in the body for a very long time. That gives us some confidence in the longer-term compatibility of this system,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced food intake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests in animals, the researchers found that inflating the balloon before meals led to a 60 percent reduction in the amount of food consumed. These studies were done over the course of a month, but the researchers now plan to do longer-term studies to see if this reduction leads to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The deployment for traditional gastric balloons is usually six months, if not more, and only then you will see good amount of weight loss. We will have to evaluate our device in a similar or longer time span to prove it really works better,” Jia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If developed for use in humans, the new gastric balloon could offer an alternative to existing obesity treatments. Other treatments for obesity include gastric bypass surgery, “stomach stapling” (a surgical procedure in which the stomach capacity is reduced), and drugs including GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gastric balloon could be an option for patients who are not good candidates for surgery or don’t respond well to weight-loss drugs, Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For certain patients who are higher-risk, who cannot undergo surgery, or did not tolerate the medication or had some other contraindication, there are limited options,” he says. “Traditional gastric balloons are still being used, but they come with a caveat that eventually the weight loss can plateau, so this is a way of trying to address that fundamental limitation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, the Karl van Tassel Career Development Professorship, the Whitaker Health Sciences Fund Fellowship, the T.S. Lin Fellowship, the MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, and the Boston University Yawkey Funded Internship Program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius is a tall order. &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/"&gt;Achieving that goal&lt;/a&gt; will not only require a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, but also a substantial reallocation of land to support that effort and sustain the biosphere, including humans. More land will be needed to accommodate a growing demand for bioenergy and nature-based carbon sequestration while ensuring sufficient acreage for food production and ecological sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expanding role of land in a 1.5 C world will be twofold — to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and to produce clean energy. Land-based carbon dioxide removal strategies include bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage/direct-air-capture"&gt;direct air capture&lt;/a&gt;; and afforestation/reforestation and other &lt;a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/05/19/what-you-need-to-know-about-nature-based-solutions-to-climate-change"&gt;nature-based solutions&lt;/a&gt;. Land-based clean energy production includes wind and solar farms and &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/statements/joint-statement-sustainable-bioenergy-climate-and-development-goals"&gt;sustainable bioenergy&lt;/a&gt; cropland. Any decision to allocate more land for climate mitigation must also address competing needs for long-term food security and ecosystem health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land-based climate mitigation choices vary in terms of costs — amount of land required, implications for food security, impact on biodiversity and other ecosystem services — and benefits — potential for sequestering greenhouse gases and producing clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/environmental-science/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1393327/full"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Environmental Science&lt;/em&gt; provides the most comprehensive analysis to date of competing land-use and technology options to limit global warming to 1.5 C. Led by researchers at the &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (CS3), the study applies the MIT Integrated Global System Modeling (IGSM) framework to evaluate costs and benefits of different land-based climate mitigation options in &lt;a href="https://globalchange.mit.edu/sites/default/files/MITJPSPGC_Rpt364.pdf"&gt;Sky2050&lt;/a&gt;, a 1.5 C climate-stabilization scenario developed by Shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this scenario, demand for bioenergy and natural carbon sinks increase along with the need for sustainable farming and food production.&amp;nbsp;To determine if there’s enough land to meet all these growing demands, the research team uses current estimates of the Earth’s total habitable land area — about 11 billion hectares or 11 gigahectares (Gha), where a hectare is an area of 10,000 square meters or 2.471 acres — and land area used for food production and bioenergy (5 Gha), and assesses how these may change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team finds that with transformative changes in policy, land management practices, and consumption patterns, global land is sufficient to provide a sustainable supply of food and ecosystem services&amp;nbsp;throughout this century while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the 1.5 C goal. These transformative changes include policies to protect natural ecosystems; stop deforestation and accelerate reforestation and afforestation; promote advances in sustainable agriculture technology and practice; reduce agricultural and food waste; and incentivize consumers to purchase sustainably produced goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If such changes are implemented, 2.5–3.5 gha of land would be used for NBS practices to sequester 3–6 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;per year, and 0.4–0.6&amp;nbsp;gha of land would be allocated for energy production — 0.2–0.3&amp;nbsp;gha for bioenergy and 0.2–0.35&amp;nbsp;gha for wind and solar power generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our scenario shows that there is enough land to support a 1.5 degree C future as long as effective policies at national and global levels are in place,” says CS3 Principal Research Scientist &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/gurgel-angelo"&gt;Angelo Gurgel&lt;/a&gt;, the study’s lead author. “These policies must not only promote efficient use of land for food, energy, and nature, but also be supported by long-term commitments from government and industry decision-makers.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>To design better water filters, MIT engineers look to manta rays </title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Filter feeders are everywhere in the animal world, from tiny crustaceans and certain types of coral and krill, to various molluscs, barnacles, and even massive basking sharks and baleen whales. Now, MIT engineers have found that one filter feeder has evolved to sift food in ways that could improve the design of industrial water filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2410018121" target="_blank"&gt;paper appearing this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team characterizes the filter-feeding mechanism of the mobula ray — a family of aquatic rays that includes two manta species and seven devil rays. Mobula rays feed by swimming open-mouthed through plankton-rich regions of the ocean and filtering plankton particles into their gullet as water streams into their mouths and out through their gills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The floor of the mobula ray’s mouth is lined on either side with parallel, comb-like structures, called plates, that siphon water into the ray’s gills. The MIT team has shown that the dimensions of these plates may allow for incoming plankton to bounce all the way across the plates and further into the ray’s cavity, rather than out through the gills. What’s more, the ray’s gills absorb oxygen from the outflowing water, helping the ray to simultaneously breathe while feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We show that the mobula ray has evolved the geometry of these plates to be the perfect size to balance feeding and breathing,” says study author Anette “Peko” Hosoi, the Pappalardo Professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineers fabricated a simple water filter modeled after the mobula ray’s plankton-filtering features. They studied how water flowed through the filter when it was fitted with 3D-printed plate-like structures. The team took the results of these experiments and drew up a blueprint, which they say designers can use to optimize industrial cross-flow filters, which are broadly similar in configuration to that of the mobula ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to expand the design space of traditional cross-flow filtration with new knowledge from the manta ray,” says lead author and MIT postdoc Xinyu Mao PhD ’24. “People can choose a parameter regime of the mobula ray so they could potentially improve overall filter performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hosoi and Mao co-authored the new study with Irmgard Bischofberger, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A better trade-off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study grew out of the group’s focus on filtration during the height of the Covid pandemic, when the researchers were designing face masks to filter out the virus. Since then, Mao has shifted focus to study filtration in animals and how certain filter-feeding mechanisms might improve filters used in industry, such as in water treatment plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mao observed that any industrial filter must strike a balance between permeability (how easily fluid can flow through a filter), and selectivity (how successful a filter is at keeping out particles of a target size). For instance, a membrane that is studded with large holes might be highly permeable, meaning a lot of water can be pumped through using very little energy. However, the membrane’s large holes would let many particles through, making it very low in selectivity. Likewise, a membrane with much smaller pores would be more selective yet also require more energy to pump the water through the smaller openings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We asked ourselves, how do we do better with this tradeoff between permeability and selectivity?” Hosoi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mao looked into filter-feeding animals, he found that the mobula ray has struck an ideal balance between permeability and selectivity: The ray is highly permeable, in that it can let water into its mouth and out through its gills quickly enough to capture oxygen to breathe. At the same time, it is highly selective, filtering and feeding on plankton rather than letting the particles stream out through the gills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers realized that the ray’s filtering features are broadly similar to that of industrial cross-flow filters. These filters are designed such that fluid flows across a permeable membrane that lets through most of the fluid, while any polluting particles continue flowing across the membrane and eventually out into a reservoir of waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wondered whether the mobula ray might inspire design improvements to industrial cross-flow filters. For that, they took a deeper dive into the dynamics of mobula ray filtration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A vortex key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of their new study, the team fabricated a simple filter inspired by the mobula ray. The filter’s design is what engineers refer to as a “leaky channel” — effectively, a pipe with holes along its sides. In this case, the team’s “channel” consists of two flat, transparent acrylic plates that are glued together at the edges, with a slight opening between the plates through which fluid can be pumped. At one end of the channel, the researchers inserted 3D-printed structures resembling the grooved plates that run along the floor of the mobula ray’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then pumped water through the channel at various rates, along with colored dye to visualize the flow. They took images across the channel and observed an interesting transition: At slow pumping rates, the flow was “very peaceful,” and fluid easily slipped through the grooves in the printed plates and out into a reservoir. When the researchers increased the pumping rate, the faster-flowing fluid did not slip through, but appeared to swirl at the mouth of each groove, creating a vortex, similar to a small knot of hair between the tips of a comb’s teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This vortex is not blocking water, but it is blocking particles,” Hosoi explains. “Whereas in a slower flow, particles go through the filter with the water, at higher flow rates, particles try to get through the filter but are blocked by this vortex and are shot down the channel instead. The vortex is helpful because it prevents particles from flowing out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team surmised that vortices are the key to mobula rays’ filter-feeding ability. The ray is able to swim at just the right speed that water, streaming into its mouth, can form vortices between the grooved plates. These vortices effectively block any plankton particles — even those that are smaller than the space between plates. The particles then bounce across the plates and head further into the ray’s cavity, while the rest of the water can still flow between the plates and out through the gills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the results of their experiments, along with dimensions of the filtering features of mobula rays, to develop a blueprint for cross-flow filtration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have provided practical guidance on how to actually filter as the mobula ray does,” Mao offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want to design a filter such that you’re in the regime where you generate vortices,” Hosoi says. “Our guidelines tell you: If you want your plant to pump at a certain rate, then your filter has to have a particular pore diameter and spacing to generate vortices that will filter out particles of this size. The mobula ray is giving us a really nice rule of thumb for rational design.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported, in part, by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and the Harvey P. Greenspan Fellowship Fund.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Her well-deserved award recognizes the potential of her research on nutrient stabilization, which could have a significant impact on society," says Ana Jaklenec, one of Zhang’s advisors and a principal investigator at MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. Zhang is also advised by David H. Koch (1962) Institute Professor Robert Langer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frameworks for global health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1703608833" paraeid="{d990ab78-4f66-4063-b7eb-179bad887d6f}{181}"&gt;In a world where nearly 2 billion people suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, particularly iron, the urgency for effective solutions has never been greater. Iron deficiency is especially harmful for vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women, since it can lead to weakened immune systems and developmental delays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="551083007" paraeid="{d990ab78-4f66-4063-b7eb-179bad887d6f}{187}"&gt;The World Health Organization has highlighted food fortification as a cost-effective strategy, yet many current methods fall short. Iron and other nutrients can break down during processing or cooking, and synthetic additives often come with high costs and environmental drawbacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="981242941" paraeid="{d990ab78-4f66-4063-b7eb-179bad887d6f}{193}"&gt;Zhang, along with her teammate, Xin Yang, a postdoc associate at Koch Institute, set out to innovate new technologies for nutrient fortification that are effective, accessible, and sustainable, leading to the invention nutritional metal-organic frameworks (NuMOFs) and the subsequent launch of MOFe Coffee, the world’s first iron-fortified coffee. NuMOFs not only protect essential nutrients such as iron while in food for long periods of time, but also make them more easily absorbed and used once consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1481617508" paraeid="{d990ab78-4f66-4063-b7eb-179bad887d6f}{215}"&gt;The inspiration for the coffee came from the success of iodized salt, which significantly reduced iodine deficiency worldwide. Because coffee and tea are associated with low iron absorption, iron fortification would directly address the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="70175249" paraeid="{d990ab78-4f66-4063-b7eb-179bad887d6f}{225}"&gt;However, replicating the success of iodized salt for iron fortification has been extremely challenging due to the micronutrient’s high reactivity and the instability of iron(II) salts. As researchers with backgrounds in material science, chemistry, and food technology, Zhang and Yang leveraged their expertise to develop a solution that could overcome these technical barriers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="302688914" paraeid="{d990ab78-4f66-4063-b7eb-179bad887d6f}{251}"&gt;The fortified coffee serves as a practical example of how NuMOFs can help people increase their iron intake by engaging in a habit that’s already part of their daily routine, with significant potential benefits for women, who are disproportionately affected by iron deficiency. The team plans to expand the technology to incorporate additional nutrients to address a wider array of nutritional deficiencies and improve health equity globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast-track to addressing global health improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="2061106427" paraeid="{8e32e0dd-a7a0-46d8-a802-0c3ebab7a1f0}{12}"&gt;Looking ahead, Zhang and Yang in the Jaklenec Group are focused on both product commercialization and ongoing research, refining MOFe Coffee to enhance nutrient stability and ensuring the product remains palatable while maximizing iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="399188990" paraeid="{8e32e0dd-a7a0-46d8-a802-0c3ebab7a1f0}{26}"&gt;Winning the CIC competition means that Zhang, Yang, and the team can fast-track their patent application with the USPTO. The team hopes that their fast-tracked patent will allow them to attract more potential investors and partners, which is crucial for scaling their efforts. A quicker patent process also means that the team can bring the technology to market faster, helping improve global nutrition and health for those who need it most.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1731237381" paraeid="{8e32e0dd-a7a0-46d8-a802-0c3ebab7a1f0}{32}"&gt;“Our goal is to make a real difference in addressing micronutrient deficiencies around the world,” says Zhang.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a new, well-equipped lab at the University del Valle de Guatemala (UVG) in June 2024, members of two Mayan farmers’ cooperatives watched closely as Rodrigo Aragón, professor of mechanical engineering at UVG, demonstrated the operation of an industrial ultrasound machine. Then he invited each of them to test the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For us, it is a dream to be able to interact with technology,” said Francisca Elizabeth Saloj Saloj, a member of the Ija´tz women’s collective, a group from Guatemala’s highlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a seven-hour bumpy bus ride, the farmers had arrived in Guatemala City with sacks full of rosemary, chamomile, and thyme. Their objective: to explore processes for extracting essential oils from their plants and to identify new products to manufacture with these oils. Currently, farmers sell their herbs in local markets for medicinal or culinary purposes. With new technology, says Aragón, they can add value to their harvest, using herb oils as the basis for perfumes, syrups, and tinctures that would reach broader markets. These goods could provide much-needed income to the farmers’ households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strategy for transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collaboration is just one part of a five-year, $15-million project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and managed by MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering in collaboration with UVG and the Guatemalan Export Association (AGEXPORT). Launched in 2021 and called ASPIRE — Achieving Sustainable Partnerships for Innovation, Research, and Entrepreneurship — the project aims to collaboratively strengthen UVG, and eventually other universities in Central America, as problem-solving powerhouses that research, design, and build solutions with and for the people most in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vision of ASPIRE is that within a decade, UVG researchers are collaborating with community members on research that generates results that are relevant to addressing local development challenges — results that are picked up and used by policymakers and actors in the private sector,” says MIT Research Scientist Elizabeth Hoffecker, a co-principal investigator of ASPIRE at MIT, and leader of the Institute’s Local Innovation Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UVG, one of Guatemala’s top universities, has embraced ASPIRE as part of its long-term strategic plan, and is now pursuing wide-ranging changes based on a playbook developed at MIT — including at MIT D-Lab, which deploys participatory design, co-creation, low-cost technologies, and capacity building to meet the complex challenges of poverty — and piloted at UVG. The ASPIRE team is working to extend the reach of its research innovation and entrepreneurship activities to its two regional campuses and to other regional universities.&amp;nbsp;The overall program is informed by MIT’s approach to development of research-driven innovation ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although lacking the resources (and PhD programs) of a typical U.S. university, UVG has big ambitions for itself, and for Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to thrive and lead the country in research and teaching, and to accomplish this, we are creating an innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem, based on best practices drawn from D-Lab and other MIT groups,” says Mónica Stein, vice-rector for research and outreach at UVG, who holds a doctorate from Stanford University in plant biology. “ASPIRE can really change the way that development work and local research is done so that it has more impact,” says Stein. “And in theory, if you have more impact, then you improve environmental outcomes, health outcomes, educational outcomes, and economic outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local innovation and entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting gears at a university and launching novel development initiatives are complex challenges, but with training and workshops conducted by D-Lab-trained collaborators and MIT-based ASPIRE staff, UVG faculty, staff, and students are embracing the change. Programs underway should sound familiar to anyone who has set foot recently on the campus of a U.S. research university: hackathons, makerspaces, pitchapaloozas, entrepreneurship competitions, and spinouts. But at UVG, all of these serve a larger purpose: addressing sustainable development goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASPIRE principal investigator Daniel Frey, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, believes some of these programs are already paying off, particularly a UVG venture mentoring service (UVG-EMS), modeled after and facilitated by MIT’s own &lt;a href="https://vms.mit.edu/"&gt;VMS program&lt;/a&gt;. “We’d like to see students building companies and improving their livelihoods and those of people from indigenous and marginalized communities,” says Frey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASPIRE project intends to enable the lowest-income communities to share more of Guatemala’s wealth, derived mainly from agricultural goods. In collaborating with AGEXPORT, which enables networking with companies across the country, the team zeroed in on creating or enhancing the value chain for several key crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Snow peas offer a great target for both research and innovation,” says Adilia Blandón, ASPIRE research project manager and professor of food engineering at UVG. Many farming communities grow snow peas, which they send along to companies for export to the U.S. Unless these peas are perfect in shape and color, Blandón explains, they don’t make it to market. Nearly a third of Guatemala’s crop is left at processing plants, turned into animal feed, or wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ASPIRE snow pea team located farmers from two cooperatives who wanted to solve this problem. At a series of co-creation sessions, these growers and mechanical engineers at UVG developed a prototype for a low-tech cart for collecting snow peas, made from easily acquired local materials, which can navigate the steep and narrow paths on the hills where the plants grow. This method avoids crushing snow peas in a conventional harvest bag. In addition, the snow pea project has engaged women at a technical school to design a harvest apron for women snow pea farmers. “This could be a business opportunity for them,” Blandón says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blandón vividly recalls her first ASPIRE workshop, focused on participatory design. “It opened my eyes as a researcher in so many ways,” she says. “I learned that instead of taking information from people, I can learn from them and create things with them that they are really excited about.” It completely changed how she approaches research, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with Mayan communities that produce snow peas, where malnourishment and illness are rampant, Blandón and ASPIRE researchers found that families don’t eat the protein-packed vegetable because they don’t find it palatable — even though so much of it is left over from harvest. Participatory design sessions with a group of mothers yielded an intriguing possibility: grinding snow peas into flour, which would then be incorporated into traditional bean- and corn-based dishes. The recipes born of this collaboration could land on WhatsApp or TikTok, mobile apps familiar to these families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building value chains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional research projects are teasing out novel ways of adding value to the products grown or made by Guatemalan hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include an educational toolkit developed with government farm extension workers to teach avocado producers how to improve their practices. The long-term goal is to grow and export larger and unblemished fruit for the lucrative U.S. market, currently dominated by Mexico. The kit, featuring simple graphics for growers who can’t read or don’t have the time, offers lessons on soil care, fertilizing, and protecting the fruit post-harvest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASPIRE UVG Research Director Ana Lucia Solano is especially proud of “an immersive, animated, Monopoly-like game that shows farmers the impact of activities like buying fertilizer on their finances,” she says.&amp;nbsp;“If small producers improve their practices, they will have better opportunities to sell their products at a better price, which may allow them to hire more people, teach others more easily, and offer better jobs and working conditions — and maybe this will help prevent farmworkers from having to leave the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solano has just begun a similar program to educate cocoa producers. “The cocoa of Guatemala is wonderful, but the growers, who have great native knowledge, also need to learn new methods so they can transform their chocolate into the kind of high-quality product expected in European markets, with the help of AGEXPORT,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the UVG Altiplano campus, Mayan instructor Jeremías Morales, who runs the maker space, trained with Amy Smith, an MIT senior lecturer and founding director of the D-Lab, to facilitate creative capacity-building programs. He is working with nearby villages on a solution for the backbreaking labor of planting broccoli seedlings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here in Guatemala, small farm holders don’t have technology to do this task,” says Solano. Through design and prototyping workshops, the village and UVG professors have developed an inexpensive device that accomplishes this painful work. “After their next iteration of this technology, we can support the participants in starting a business,” says Solano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to invent solutions to commonplace but vexing problems keep popping up. A small village of 100 families has to share two mills to grind corn for their tortillas. It’s a major household expense. With ASPIRE facilitators, a group of women designed a prototype corn mill for home use. “They were skeptical at first, especially when their initial prototypes didn’t work,” reports Solano, “but when they finally succeeded, there was so much excitement about the results, an energy and happiness that you could feel in the room.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopting an MIT mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feeling of empowerment, a pillar of sustainable development, has great meaning for UVG Professor Victor Hugo Ayerdi, an ASPIRE project manager and director of UVG’s Department of Mechanical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In college and after I graduated, I thought since everything came from developed countries, and I was in a developing country, I couldn’t invent products.” With that mindset, he says, he went to work in manufacturing and sales for an international tire manufacturing company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when he arrived at UVG in 2009, Ayerdi heard from mechanical engineering students who craved practical experience designing and building things. Determined to create maker spaces for the three UVG campuses, he took a field trip to MIT, whose motto is “mens et manus” or “mind and hand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trip changed my life,” he says. “The MIT mindset is to believe in yourself, try things, and fail, but assume there has to be a way to do it.”&amp;nbsp;As a result, he says, he realized UVG faculty and students could also use scientific and engineering knowledge to invent products, become entrepreneurs, spark economic growth; they had the capacity. He and other UVG colleagues were primed for change when the ASPIRE opportunity emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As some ASPIRE research projects wind down their initial phases, others are just gearing up, including an effort to fashion a water purification system from the shells of farmed shrimp. “We are only just starting to get results from our research,” says Stein. “But we are totally betting on the ASPIRE model because it works at MIT and other places.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASPIRE researchers acknowledge they are looking at long timelines to make significant inroads against environmental, health, educational, and economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My greatest hope is that ASPIRE will have planted the seed of this innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem model, and that in a decade, UVG will have optimized the different programs, whether in training, entrepreneurship, or research, enough to actively transfer them to other Central American universities,” says Stein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to be the hub of this network and we want to stay connected, because, in theory, we can work together on problems that we have in common in our region. That would be really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As Earth’s temperature rises, agricultural practices will need to adapt. Droughts will likely become more frequent, and some land may no longer be arable. On top of that is the challenge of feeding an ever-growing population without expanding the production of fertilizer and other agrochemicals, which have a large carbon footprint that is contributing to the overall warming of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers across MIT are taking on these agricultural challenges from a variety of angles, from engineering plants that sound an alarm when they’re under stress to making seeds more resilient to drought. These types of technologies, and more yet to be devised, will be essential to feed the world’s population as the climate changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After water, the first thing we need is food. In terms of priority, there is water, food, and then everything else. As we are trying to find new strategies to support a world of 10 billion people, it will require us to invent new ways of making food,” says Benedetto Marelli, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marelli is the director of one of the six missions of the recently launched&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://climateproject.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Climate Project at MIT&lt;/a&gt;, which focus on research areas such as decarbonizing industry and building resilient cities. Marelli directs the Wild Cards mission, which aims to identify unconventional solutions that are high-risk and high-reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on expertise from a breadth of fields, MIT is well-positioned to tackle the challenges posed by climate change, Marelli says. “Bringing together our strengths across disciplines, including engineering, processing at scale, biological engineering, and infrastructure engineering, along with humanities, science, and economics, presents a great opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting seeds from drought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marelli, who began his career as a biomedical engineer working on regenerative medicine, is now developing ways to boost crop yields by helping seeds to survive and germinate during drought conditions, or in soil that has been depleted of nutrients. To achieve that, he has devised&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/seeds-drought-coating-0708" target="_blank"&gt;seed coatings&lt;/a&gt;, based on silk and other polymers, that can envelop and nourish seeds during the critical germination process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/seeds-drought-coating-0708"&gt;&lt;img class="image" src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-Drought-Seeds-01-press_0.jpg" data-align="center" alt="germinating seeds in special coating" width="899" height="600" data-caption="&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://news.mit.edu/2021/seeds-drought-coating-0708&amp;quot;&amp;gt;A new seed-coating process could facilitate agriculture on marginal arid lands by enabling the seeds to retain any available water.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy soil, plants have access to nitrogen, phosphates, and other nutrients that they need, many of which are supplied by microbes that live in the soil. However, in soil that has suffered from drought or overfarming, these nutrients are lacking. Marelli’s idea was to coat the seeds with a polymer that can be embedded with plant-growth-promoting bacteria that “fix” nitrogen by absorbing it from the air and making it available to plants. The microbes can also make other necessary nutrients available to plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first generation of the seed coatings, he embedded these microbes in coatings made of silk — a material that he had previously shown can extend the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-based-startup-cambridge-crops-wraps-food-in-silk-0605" target="_blank"&gt;shelf life&lt;/a&gt; of produce, meat, and other foods.&amp;nbsp;In his lab at MIT, Marelli has shown that the seed coatings can help germinating plants survive drought, ultraviolet light exposure, and high salinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, working with researchers at the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco, he is adapting the approach to crops native to Morocco, a country that has experienced six consecutive years of drought due a drop in rainfall linked to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these studies, the researchers are using a biopolymer coating derived from food waste that can be easily obtained in Morocco, instead of silk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re working with local communities to extract the biopolymers, to try to have a process that works at scale so that we make materials that work in that specific environment.” Marelli says. “We may come up with an idea here at MIT within a high-resource environment, but then to work there, we need to talk with the local communities, with local stakeholders, and use their own ingenuity and try to match our solution with something that could actually be applied in the local environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbes as fertilizers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they are experiencing drought or not, crops grow much better when synthetic fertilizers are applied. Although it’s essential to most farms,&amp;nbsp;applying fertilizer is expensive and has environmental consequences. Most of the world’s fertilizer is produced using the Haber-Bosch process, which converts nitrogen and hydrogen to ammonia at high temperatures and pressures. This energy intensive process accounts for about 1.5 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the transportation required to deliver it to farms around the world adds even more emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ariel Furst, the Paul M. Cook Career Development Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT,&amp;nbsp;is developing a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/microbes-could-reduce-need-for-chemical-fertilizers-1115" target="_blank"&gt;microbial alternative&lt;/a&gt; to the Haber-Bosch process. Some farms have experimented with applying nitrogen-fixing bacteria directly to the roots of their crops, which has shown some success. However, the microbes are too delicate to be stored long-term or shipped anywhere, so they must be produced in a bioreactor on the farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/microbes-could-reduce-need-for-chemical-fertilizers-1115"&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-Microbial-Fertilizer-01-press_0.jpg" data-align="center" data-entity-uuid="15d5b2f9-5bc8-4399-9bf9-1b12eb92f299" data-entity-type="file" alt="Illustration of a thriving plant and its roots in the ground that are surrounded by microbes.

The coating also protects microbes from damage caused by freeze-drying — a process that would make them easier to transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coatings can vary in composition, but they all consist of two components. One is a metal such as iron, manganese, or zinc, and the other is a polyphenol — a type of plant-derived organic compound that includes tannins and other antioxidants. These two components self-assemble into a protective shell that encapsulates bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These microbes would be delivered with the seeds, so it would remove the need for fertilizing mid-growing. It also reduces the cost and provides more autonomy to the farmers and decreases carbon emissions associated with agriculture,” Furst says.&amp;nbsp;“We think it’ll be a way to make agriculture completely regenerative, so to bring back soil health while also boosting crop yields and the nutrient density of the crops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furst has founded a company called Seia Bio, which is working on commercializing the coated microbes and has begun testing them on farms in Brazil. In her lab, Furst is also working on adapting the approach to coat microbes that can capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into limestone, which helps to raise the soil pH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can help change the pH of soil to stabilize it, while also being a way to effectively perform direct air capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,” she says. “Right now, farmers may truck in limestone to change the pH of soil, and so you’re creating a lot of emissions to bring something in that microbes can do on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distress sensors for plants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT, began to explore the idea of using plants themselves as sensors that could reveal when they’re in distress. When plants experience drought, attack by pests, or other kinds of stress, they produce hormones and other signaling molecules to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strano, whose lab specializes in developing tiny sensors for a variety of molecules, wondered if such sensors could be deployed inside plants to pick up those distress signals. To create their sensors, Strano’s lab takes advantage of the special properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes, which emit fluorescent light. By wrapping the tubes with different types of polymers, the sensors can be tuned to detect specific targets, giving off a fluorescent signal when the target is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For use in plants, Strano and his colleagues&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/plant-sensors-could-be-early-warning-system-farmers-0417" target="_blank"&gt;created sensors&lt;/a&gt; that could detect signaling molecules such as salicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide. They then showed that these sensors could be inserted into the underside of plant leaves, without harming the plants. Once embedded in the mesophyll of the leaves, the sensors can pick up a variety of signals, which can be read with an infrared camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/plant-sensors-could-be-early-warning-system-farmers-0417"&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-Plant-Sensor-01-press_0.jpg" data-entity-uuid="eddfb897-1745-4953-8a39-c8cb77c0986d" data-entity-type="file" alt="Illustration of bok choy has, on left, leaves being attacked by aphids, and on right, leaves burned by the sun’s heat. Two word balloons show the plant is responding with alarm: “!!!”" width="900" height="600" data-caption="&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://news.mit.edu/2024/plant-sensors-could-be-early-warning-system-farmers-0417&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Sensors that detect plant signaling molecules can reveal when crops are experiencing too much light or heat, or attack from insects or microbes.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sensors can reveal, in real-time, whether a plant is experiencing a variety of stresses. Until now, there hasn’t been a way to get that information fast enough for farmers to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’re trying to do is make tools that get information into the hands of farmers very quickly, fast enough for them to make adaptive decisions that can increase yield,” Strano says.&amp;nbsp;“We’re in the middle of a revolution of really understanding the way in which plants internally communicate and communicate with other plants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of sensing could be deployed in fields, where it could help farmers respond more quickly to drought and other stresses, or in greenhouses, vertical farms, and other types of indoor farms that use technology to grow crops in a controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Strano’s work in this area has been conducted with the support of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and as part of the Disruptive and Sustainable Technologies for Agricultural Precision (DiSTAP) program at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), and sensors have been deployed in tests in crops at a controlled environment farm in Singapore called Growy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The same basic kinds of tools can help detect problems in open field agriculture or in controlled environment agriculture,” Strano says. “They both suffer from the same problem, which is that the farmers get information too late to prevent yield loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing pesticide use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pesticides represent another huge financial expense for farmers: Worldwide, farmers spend about $60 billion per year on pesticides. Much of this pesticide ends up accumulating in water and soil, where it can harm many species, including humans. But, without using pesticides, farmers may lose more than half of their crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kripa Varanasi, an MIT professor of mechanical engineering, is working on tools that can help farmers measure how much pesticide is reaching their plants, as well as technologies that can help pesticides adhere to plants more efficiently, reducing the amount that runs off into soil and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varanasi, whose research focuses on interactions between liquid droplets and surfaces, began to think about applying his work to agriculture more than a decade ago, after attending a conference at the USDA. There, he was inspired to begin developing ways to improve the efficiency of pesticide application by optimizing the interactions that occur at leaf surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Billions of drops of pesticide are being sprayed on every acre of crop, and only a small fraction is ultimately reaching and staying on target. This seemed to me like a problem that we could help to solve,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varanasi and his students began exploring strategies to make drops of pesticide stick to leaves better, instead of bouncing off. They&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/reducing-runoff-pollution-making-spray-droplets-less-bouncy-0830" target="_blank"&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt; if they added polymers with positive and negative charges, the oppositely charged droplets would form a hydrophilic (water-attracting) coating on the leaf surface, which helps the next droplets applied to stick to the leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/reducing-pesticide-use-while-increasing-effectiveness-agzen-0312"&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-New-KripaV-image.jpg" data-align="center" data-entity-uuid="e4a0518c-85a7-4d71-ae76-0db8350112a9" data-entity-type="file" alt="A farm vehicle uses a long arm to spray many crops. Inset on left shows an iPad with an app showing “coverage history” and speed as “good.” On left, another inset shows leaves, and the sprayed chemical shows up as bright blue." width="900" height="600" data-caption="&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://news.mit.edu/2024/reducing-pesticide-use-while-increasing-effectiveness-agzen-0312&amp;quot;&amp;gt;AgZen has developed a system for farming that can monitor exactly how much of the sprayed chemicals adheres to plants, in real time, as the sprayer drives through a field.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, they developed an easier-to-use technology in which a surfactant is added to the pesticide before spraying. When this mixture is sprayed through a special nozzle, it forms tiny droplets that are “cloaked” in surfactant. The surfactant helps the droplets to stick to the leaves within a few milliseconds, without bouncing off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Varanasi and Vishnu Jayaprakash SM ’19, PhD ’22 founded a company called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/reducing-pesticide-use-while-increasing-effectiveness-agzen-0312" target="_blank"&gt;AgZen&lt;/a&gt; to commercialize their technologies and get them into the hands of farmers. They incorporated their ideas for improving pesticide adhesion into a product called EnhanceCoverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the testing for this product, they realized that there weren’t any good ways to measure how many of the droplets were staying on the plant. That led them to develop a product known as RealCoverage, which is based on machine vision. It can be attached to any pesticide sprayer and offer real-time feedback on what percentage of the pesticide droplets are sticking to and staying on every leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealCoverage was used on 65,000 acres of farmland across the United States in 2024, from soybeans in Iowa to cotton in Georgia. Farmers who used the product were able to reduce their pesticide use by 30 to 50 percent, by using the data to optimize delivery and, in some cases, even change what chemicals were sprayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hopes that the EnhanceCoverage product, which is expected to become available in 2025, will help farmers further reduce their pesticide use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our mission here is to help farmers with savings while helping them achieve better yields. We have found a way to do all this while also reducing waste and the amount of chemicals that we put into our atmosphere and into our soils and into our water,” Varanasi says. “This is the MIT approach: to figure out what are the real issues and how to come up with solutions. Now we have a tool and I hope that it’s deployed everywhere and everyone gets the benefit from it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-36cd180c-7fff-24cc-d4d7-86d852deb591"&gt;In a first for both universities, MIT undergraduates are engaged in research projects at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG), while MIT scholars are collaborating with UVG undergraduates on in-depth field studies in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-36cd180c-7fff-24cc-d4d7-86d852deb591"&gt;These pilot projects are part of a larger enterprise, called ASPIRE (Achieving Sustainable Partnerships for Innovation, Research, and Entrepreneurship). Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, this five-year, $15-million initiative brings together MIT, UVG, and the Guatemalan Exporters Association to promote sustainable solutions to local development challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This research is yielding insights into our understanding of how to design with and for marginalized people, specifically Indigenous people,” says Elizabeth Hoffecker, co-principal investigator of ASPIRE at MIT and director of the MIT Local Innovation Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The students’ work is bearing fruit in the form of publications and new products — directly advancing ASPIRE’s goals to create an innovation ecosystem in Guatemala that can be replicated elsewhere in Central and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the students, the project offers rewards both tangible and inspirational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My experience allowed me to find my interest in local innovation and entrepreneurship,” says Ximena Sarmiento García, a fifth-year undergraduate at UVG majoring in anthropology. Supervised by Hoffecker, Sarmiento García says, “I learned how to inform myself, investigate, and find solutions — to become a researcher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sandra Youssef, a rising junior in mechanical engineering at MIT, collaborated with UVG researchers and Indigenous farmers to design a mobile cart to improve the harvest yield of snow peas. “It was perfect for me,” she says. “My goal was to use creative, new technologies and science to make a dent in difficult problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote and effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Kendra Leith, co-principal investigator of ASPIRE, and associate director for research at MIT D-Lab, shaped the MIT-based undergraduate research opportunities (UROPs) in concert with UVG colleagues. “Although MIT students aren’t currently permitted to travel to Guatemala,&amp;nbsp;I wanted them to have an opportunity to apply their experience and knowledge to address real-world challenges,” says Leith. “The Covid pandemic prepared them and their counterparts at UVG for effective remote collaboration — the UROPs completed remarkably productive research projects over Zoom and met our goals for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT students participated in some of UVG’s most ambitious ASPIRE research. For instance, Sydney Baller, a rising sophomore in mechanical engineering, joined a team of Indigenous farmers and UVG mechanical engineers investigating the manufacturing process and potential markets for essential oils extracted from thyme, rosemary, and chamomile plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Indigenous people have thousands of years working with plant extracts and ancient remedies,” says Baller. “There is promising history there that would be important to follow up with more modern research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sandra Youssef used computer-aided design and manufacturing to realize a design created in a hackathon by snow pea farmers. “Our cart had to hold 495 pounds of snow peas without collapsing or overturning, navigate narrow paths on hills, and be simple and inexpensive to assemble,” she says. The snow pea producers have tested two of Youssef’s designs, built by a team at UVG led by Rony Herrarte, a faculty member in the department of mechanical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From waste to filter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Two MIT undergraduates joined one of UVG’s long-standing projects: addressing pollution in Guatemala’s water. The research seeks to use chitosan molecules, extracted from shrimp shells, for bioremediation of heavy metals and other water contaminants. These shells are available in abundance, left as waste by the country’s shrimp industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sophomores Ariana Hodlewsky, majoring in chemical engineering, and Paolo Mangiafico, majoring in brain and cognitive sciences, signed on to work with principal investigator and chemistry department instructor Allan Vásquez (UVG) on filtration systems utilizing chitosan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The team wants to find a cost-effective product rural communities, most at risk from polluted water, can use in homes or in town water systems,” says Mangiafico. “So we have been investigating different technologies for water filtration, and analyzing the Guatemalan and U.S. markets to understand the regulations and opportunities that might affect introduction of a chitosan-based product.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Our research into how different communities use water and into potential consumers and pitfalls sets the scene for prototypes UVG wants to produce,” says Hodlewsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lourdes Figueroa, UVG ASPIRE project manager for technology transfer, found their assistance invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Paolo and Ariana brought the MIT culture and mindset to the project,” she says. “They wanted to understand not only how the technology works, but the best ways of getting the technology out of the lab to make it useful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This was an “Aha!” moment, says Figueroa. “The MIT students made a major contribution to both the engineering and marketing sides by emphasizing that you have to think about how to guarantee the market acceptance of the technology while it is still under development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;UVG’s three campuses have served as incubators for problem-solving innovation and entrepreneurship, in many cases driven by students from Indigenous communities and families. In 2022, Elizabeth Hoffecker, with eight UVG anthropology majors, set out to identify the most vibrant examples of these collaborative initiatives, which ASPIRE seeks to promote and replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hoffecker’s “innovation ecosystem diagnostic” revealed a cluster of activity centered on UVG’s Altiplano campus in the central highlands, which serves Mayan communities. Hoffecker and two of the anthropology students focused on four examples for a series of case studies, which they&amp;nbsp;are currently preparing for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The caliber of their work was so good that it became clear to me that we could collaborate on a paper,” says Hoffecker. “It was my first time publishing with undergraduates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers’ cases included novel production of traditional thread, and creation of a 3D phytoplankton kit&amp;nbsp;that is being used to educate community members about water pollution in Lake Atitlán, a tourist destination that drives the local economy but is increasingly being affected by toxic algae blooms. Hoffecker singles out a project by Indigenous undergraduates who developed play-based teaching tools for introducing basic mathematical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“These connect to local Mayan ways of understanding and offer a novel, hands-on way to strengthen the math teaching skills of local primary school teachers in Indigenous communities,” says Hoffecker. “They created something that addresses a very immediate need in the community — lack of training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Both of Hoffecker’s undergraduate collaborators are writing theses&amp;nbsp;inspired by&amp;nbsp;these case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My time with Elizabeth allowed me to learn how to conduct research from scratch, ask for help, find solutions, and trust myself,” says Sarmiento García. She finds the ASPIRE approach profoundly appealing. “It is not only ethical, but also deeply committed to applying results to the real lives of the people involved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This experience has been incredibly positive, validating my own ability to generate knowledge through research, rather than relying only on established authors to back up my arguments,” says Camila del Cid, a fifth-year anthropology student. “This was empowering, especially as a Latin American researcher, because it emphasized that my perspective and contributions are important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hoffecker says this pilot run with UVG undergrads produced “high-quality research that can inform evidence-based decision-making on development issues of top regional priority” — a key goal for ASPIRE. Hoffecker plans to “develop a pathway that other UVG students can follow to conduct similar research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT undergraduate research will continue. “Our students’ activities have been very valuable in Guatemala, so much so that the snow pea, chitosan, and essential oils teams would like to continue working with our students this year,” says Leith.&amp;nbsp; She anticipates a new round of MIT UROPs for next summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Youssef, for one, is eager to get to work on refining the snow pea cart. “I like the idea of working outside my comfort zone, thinking about things that seem unsolvable and coming up with a solution to fix some aspect of the problem,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to connect a certain amount of average global warming with one’s everyday experience, so researchers at MIT have devised a different approach to quantifying the direct impact of climate change. Instead of focusing on global averages, they came up with the concept of “outdoor days”: the number days per year in a given location when the temperature is not too hot or cold to enjoy normal outdoor activities, such as going for a walk, playing sports, working in the garden, or dining outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/new-way-quantify-climate-change-impacts-outdoor-days-0322"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year, the researchers applied this method to compare the impact of global climate change on different countries around the world, showing that much of the global south would suffer major losses in the number of outdoor days, while some northern countries could see a slight increase. Now, they have applied the same approach to comparing the outcomes for different parts of the United States, dividing the country into nine climatic regions, and finding similar results: Some states, especially Florida and other parts of the Southeast, should see a significant drop in outdoor days, while some, especially in the Northwest, should see a slight increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at correlations between economic activity, such as tourism trends, and changing climate conditions, and examined how numbers of outdoor days could result in significant social and economic impacts. Florida’s economy, for example, is highly dependent on tourism and on people moving there for its pleasant climate; a major drop in days when it is comfortable to spend time outdoors could make the state less of a draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings were &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL111607"&gt;published this month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a paper by researchers Yeon-Woo Choi and Muhammad Khalifa and professor of civil and environmental engineering Elfatih Eltahir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is something very new in our attempt to understand impacts of climate change impact, in addition to the changing extremes,” Choi says. It allows people to see how these global changes may impact them on a very personal level, as opposed to focusing on global temperature changes or on extreme events such as powerful hurricanes or increased wildfires. “To the best of my knowledge, nobody else takes this same approach” in quantifying the local impacts of climate change, he says. “I hope that many others will parallel our approach to better understand how climate may affect our daily lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at two different climate scenarios — one where maximum efforts are made to curb global emissions of greenhouse gases and one “worst case” scenario where little is done and global warming continues to accelerate. They used these two scenarios with every available global climate model, 32 in all, and the results were broadly consistent across all 32 models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality may lie somewhere in between the two extremes that were modeled, Eltahir suggests. “I don’t think we’re going to act as aggressively” as the low-emissions scenarios suggest, he says, “and we may not be as careless” as the high-emissions scenario. “Maybe the reality will emerge in the middle, toward the end of the century,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at the difference in temperatures and other conditions over various ranges of decades. The data already showed some slight differences in outdoor days from the 1961-1990 period compared to 1991-2020. The researchers then compared these most recent 30 years with the last 30 years of this century, as projected by the models, and found much greater differences ahead for some regions. The strongest effects in the modeling were seen in the Southeastern states. “It seems like climate change is going to have a significant impact on the Southeast in terms of reducing the number of outdoor days,” Eltahir says, “with implications for the quality of life of the population, and also for the attractiveness of tourism and for people who want to retire there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that “surprisingly, one of the regions that would benefit a little bit is the Northwest.” But the gain there is modest: an increase of about 14 percent in outdoor days projected for the last three decades of this century, compared to the period from 1976 to 2005. The Southwestern U.S., by comparison, faces an average loss of 23 percent of their outdoor days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also digs into the relationship between climate and economic activity by looking at tourism trends from U.S. National Park Service visitation data, and how that aligned with differences in climate conditions. “Accounting for seasonal variations, we find a clear connection between the number of outdoor days and the number of tourist visits in the United States,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the country, there will be little overall change in the total number of annual outdoor days, the study found, but the seasonal pattern of those days could change significantly. While most parts of the country now see the most outdoor days in summertime, that will shift as summers get hotter, and spring and fall will become the preferred seasons for outdoor activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, Eltahir says, “what we are talking about that will happen in the future [for most of the country] is already happening in Florida.” There, he says, “the really enjoyable time of year is in the spring and fall, and summer is not the best time of year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People’s level of comfort with temperatures varies somewhat among individuals and among regions, so the researchers designed a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://eltahir.mit.edu/globaloutdoordays/"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, now freely available online, that allows people to set their own definitions of the lowest and highest temperatures they consider suitable for outdoor activities, and then see what the climate models predict would be the change in the number of outdoor days for their location, using their own standards of comfort. For their study, they used a widely accepted range of 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) to 25 C (77 F), which is the “thermoneutral zone” in which the human body does not require either metabolic heat generation or evaporative cooling to maintain its core temperature — in other words, in that range there is generally no need to either shiver or sweat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model mainly focuses on temperature but also allows people to include humidity or precipitation in their definition of what constitutes a comfortable outdoor day. The model could be extended to incorporate other variables such as air quality, but the researchers say temperature tends to be the major determinant of comfort for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using their software tool, “If you disagree with how we define an outdoor day, you could define one for yourself, and then you’ll see what the impacts of that are on your number of outdoor days and their seasonality,” Eltahir says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was inspired by the realization, he says, that “people’s understanding of climate change is based on the assumption that climate change is something that’s going to happen sometime in the future and going to happen to someone else. It’s not going to impact them directly. And I think that contributes to the fact that we are not doing enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the concept of outdoor days “brings the concept of climate change home, brings it to personal everyday activities,” he says. “I hope that people will find that useful to bridge that gap, and provide a better understanding and appreciation of the problem. And hopefully that would help lead to sound policies that are based on science, regarding climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was based on work supported by the Community Jameel for Jameel Observatory CREWSnet and Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder how your favorite snack was sourced? Joshua Reed-Diawuoh thinks more people should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reed-Diawuoh MBA ’20 is the founder and CEO of GRIA Food Company, which partners with companies that ethically source and process food in West Africa to support local food economies and help communities in the region more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very difficult for these agribusinesses and producers to start sustainable businesses and build up that value chain in the area,” says Reed-Diawuoh, who started the company as a student in the MIT Sloan School of Management. “We want to support these companies that put in the work to build integrated businesses that are employing people and uplifting communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRIA, which stands for “Grown in Africa,” is currently selling six types of flavored cashews sourced from Benin, Togo, and Burkina Faso. All of the cashews are certified by Fairtrade International, which means in addition to offering sustainable wages, access to financing, and decent working conditions, the companies receive a “Fairtrade Premium” on top of the selling price that allows them to invest in the long-term health of their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That premium is transformational,” Reed-Diawuoh says. “The premium goes to the producer cooperatives, or the farmers working the land, and they can invest that in any way they choose. They can put it back into their business, they can start new community development projects, like building schools or improving wastewater infrastructure, whatever they want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cracking the nut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reed-Diawuoh’s family is from Ghana, and before coming to MIT Sloan, he worked to support agriculture and food manufacturing for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with particular focus on uplifting small-scale farmers. That’s where he learned about difficulties with financing and infrastructure constraints that held many companies back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to get my hands dirty and start my own business that contributed to improving agricultural development in West Africa,” Reed-Diawuoh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He entered MIT Sloan in 2018, taking entrepreneurship classes and exploring several business ideas before deciding to ethically source produce from farmers and sell directly to consumers. He says MIT Sloan’s Sustainability Business Lab offered particularly valuable lessons for how to structure his business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his second year, Reed-Diawuoh was selected for a fellowship at the Legatum Center, which connected him to other entrepreneurs working in emerging markets around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Legatum was a pivotal milestone for me,” he says. “It provided me with some structure and space to develop this idea. It also gave me an incredible opportunity to take risks and explore different business concepts in a way I couldn’t have done if I was working in industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business model Reed-Diawuoh settled on for GRIA sources product from agribusiness partners in West Africa that adhere to the strictest environmental and labor standards. Reed-Diawuoh decided to start with cashews because they have many manual processing steps — from shelling to peeling and roasting — that are often done after the cashews are shipped out of West Africa, limiting the growth of local food economies and taking wealth out of communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of GRIA’s partners, from the companies harvesting cashews to the processing facilities, works directly with farmer cooperatives and small-scale farmers and is certified by Fairtrade International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without proper oversight and regulations, workers oftentimes get exploited, and child labor is a huge problem across the agriculture sector,” Reed-Diawuoh says. “Fairtrade certifications try and take a robust and rigorous approach to auditing all of the businesses and their supply chains, from producers to farmers to processors. They do on-site visits and they audit financial documents. We went through this over the course of a thorough three-month review.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After importing cashew kernels, GRIA flavors and packages them at a production facility in Boston. Reed-Diawuoh started by selling to small independent retailers in Greater Boston before scaling up GRIA’s online sales. He started ramping up production in the beginning of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time we sell our product, if people weren’t already familiar with Fairtrade or ethical sourcing, we provide information on our packaging and all of our collateral,” Reed-Diawuoh says. “We want to spread this message about the importance of ethical sourcing and the importance of building up food manufacturing in West Africa in particular, but also in rising economies throughout the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making ethical sourcing mainstream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRIA currently imports about a ton of Fairtrade cashews and kernels each quarter, and Reed-Diawuoh hopes to double that number each year for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For each pound, we pay premiums for the kernels, and that supports this ecosystem where producers get compensated fairly for their work on the land, and agribusinesses are able to build more robust and profitable business models, because they have an end market for these Fairtrade-certified products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reed-Diawuoh is currently trying out different packaging and flavors and is in discussions with partners to expand production capacity and move into Ghana. He’s also exploring corporate collaborations and has provided MIT with product over the past two years for conferences and other events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re experimenting with different growth strategies,” Reed-Diawuoh says. “We’re very much still in startup mode, but really trying to ramp up our sales and production.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As GRIA scales,&amp;nbsp;Reed-Diawuoh hopes it pushes consumers to start asking more of their favorite food brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s absolutely critical that, if we’re sourcing produce in markets like the U.S. from places like West Africa, we’re hyper-focused on doing it in an ethical manner,” Reed-Diawuoh says. “The overall goal of GRIA is to ensure we are adhering to and promoting strict sourcing standards and being rigorous and thoughtful about the way we import product.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have built a new desalination system that runs with the rhythms of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solar-powered system removes salt from water at a pace that closely follows changes in solar energy. As sunlight increases through the day, the system ramps up its desalting process and automatically adjusts to any sudden variation in sunlight, for example by dialing down in response to a passing cloud or revving up as the skies clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the system can quickly react to subtle changes in sunlight, it maximizes the utility of solar energy, producing large quantities of clean water despite variations in sunlight throughout the day. In contrast to other solar-driven desalination designs, the MIT system requires no extra batteries for energy storage, nor a supplemental power supply, such as from the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineers tested a community-scale prototype on groundwater wells in New Mexico over six months, working in variable weather conditions and water types. The system harnessed on average over 94 percent of the electrical energy generated from the system’s solar panels to produce up to 5,000 liters of water per day despite large swings in weather and available sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conventional desalination technologies require steady power and need battery storage to smooth out a variable power source like solar. By continually varying power consumption in sync with the sun, our technology directly and efficiently uses solar power to make water,” says Amos Winter, the Germeshausen Professor of Mechanical Engineering and director of the K. Lisa Yang Global Engineering and Research (GEAR) Center at MIT. “Being able to make drinking water with renewables, without requiring battery storage, is a massive grand challenge. And we’ve done it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is geared toward desalinating brackish groundwater — a salty source of water that is found in underground reservoirs and is more prevalent than fresh groundwater resources. The researchers see brackish groundwater as a huge untapped source of potential drinking water, particularly as reserves of fresh water are stressed in parts of the world. They envision that the new renewable, battery-free system could provide much-needed drinking water at low costs, especially for inland communities where access to seawater and grid power are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The majority of the population actually lives far enough from the coast, that seawater desalination could never reach them. They consequently rely heavily on groundwater, especially in remote, low-income regions. And unfortunately, this groundwater is becoming more and more saline due to climate change,” says Jonathan Bessette, MIT PhD student in mechanical engineering. “This technology could bring sustainable, affordable clean water to underreached places around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers report details the new system in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00314-6" target="_blank"&gt;paper appearing today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study’s co-authors are Bessette, Winter, and staff engineer Shane Pratt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pump and flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system builds on a previous design, which Winter and his colleagues, including former MIT postdoc Wei He, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s44221-024-00213-w?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oa_20240326&amp;amp;utm_content=10.1038%2Fs44221-024-00213-w" target="_blank"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. That system aimed to desalinate water through “flexible batch electrodialysis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrodialysis and reverse osmosis are two of the main methods used to desalinate brackish groundwater. With reverse osmosis, pressure is used to pump salty water through a membrane and filter out salts. Electrodialysis uses an electric field to draw out salt ions as water is pumped through a stack of ion-exchange membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have looked to power both methods with renewable sources. But this has been especially challenging for reverse osmosis systems, which traditionally run at a steady power level that’s incompatible with naturally variable energy sources such as the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter, He, and their colleagues focused on electrodialysis, seeking ways to make a more flexible, “time-variant” system that would be responsive to variations in renewable, solar power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their previous design, the team built an electrodialysis system consisting of water pumps, an ion-exchange membrane stack, and a solar panel array. The innovation in this system was a model-based control system that used sensor readings from every part of the system to predict the optimal rate at which to pump water through the stack and the voltage that should be applied to the stack to maximize the amount of salt drawn out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team tested this system in the field, it was able to vary its water production with the sun’s natural variations. On average, the system directly used 77 percent of the available electrical energy produced by the solar panels, which the team estimated was 91 percent more than traditionally designed solar-powered electrodialysis systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers felt they could do better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We could only calculate every three minutes, and in that time, a cloud could literally come by and block the sun,” Winter says. “The system could be saying, ‘I need to run at this high power.’ But some of that power has suddenly dropped because there’s now less sunlight. So, we had to make up that power with extra batteries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar commands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their latest work, the researchers looked to eliminate the need for batteries, by shaving the system’s response time to a fraction of a second. The new system is able to update its desalination rate, three to five times per second. The faster response time enables the system to adjust to changes in sunlight throughout the day, without having to make up any lag in power with additional power supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to the nimbler desalting is a simpler control strategy, devised by Bessette and Pratt. The new strategy is one of “flow-commanded current control,” in which the system first senses the amount of solar power that is being produced by the system’s solar panels. If the panels are generating more power than the system is using, the controller automatically “commands” the system to dial up its pumping, pushing more water through the electrodialysis stacks. Simultaneously, the system diverts some of the additional solar power by increasing the electrical current delivered to the stack, to drive more salt out of the faster-flowing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s say the sun is rising every few seconds,” Winter explains. “So, three times a second, we’re looking at the solar panels and saying, ‘Oh, we have more power — let’s bump up our flow rate and current a little bit.’ When we look again and see there’s still more excess power, we’ll up it again. As we do that, we’re able to closely match our consumed power with available solar power really accurately, throughout the day. And the quicker we loop this, the less battery buffering we need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineers incorporated the new control strategy into a fully automated system that they sized to desalinate brackish groundwater at a daily volume that would be enough to supply a small community of about 3,000 people. They operated the system for six months on several wells at the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Throughout the trial, the prototype operated under a wide range of solar conditions, harnessing over 94 percent of the solar panel’s electrical energy, on average, to directly power desalination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Compared to how you would traditionally design a solar desal system, we cut our required battery capacity by almost 100 percent,” Winter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineers plan to further test and scale up the system in hopes of supplying larger communities, and even whole municipalities, with low-cost, fully sun-driven drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this is a major step forward, we’re still working diligently to continue developing lower cost, more sustainable desalination methods,” Bessette says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our focus now is on testing, maximizing reliability, and building out a product line that can provide desalinated water using renewables to multiple markets around&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;world," Pratt adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team will be launching a company based on their technology in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, the Julia Burke Foundation, and the MIT Morningside Academy of Design. This work was additionally supported in-kind by Veolia Water Technologies and Solutions and Xylem Goulds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inventive solutions to some of the world’s most critical problems are being discovered in labs, classrooms, and centers across MIT every day. Many of these solutions move from the lab to the commercial world with the help of over 85 Institute resources that comprise MIT’s robust innovation and entrepreneurship (I&amp;amp;E) ecosystem. The Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) draws on MIT’s wealth of I&amp;amp;E knowledge and experience to help researchers commercialize their breakthrough technologies through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions grant program&lt;/a&gt;. By collaborating with I&amp;amp;E programs on campus, J-WAFS prepares MIT researchers for the commercial world, where their novel innovations aim to improve productivity, accessibility, and sustainability of water and food systems, creating economic, environmental, and societal benefits along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J-WAFS Solutions program launched in 2015 with support from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.communityjameel.org/"&gt;Community Jameel&lt;/a&gt;, an international organization that advances science and learning for communities to thrive. Since 2015, J-WAFS Solutions has supported 19 projects with one-year grants of up to $150,000, with some projects receiving renewal grants for a second year of support. Solutions projects all address challenges related to water or food. Modeled after the esteemed grant program of MIT’s Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, and initially administered by Deshpande Center staff, the J-WAFS Solutions program follows a similar approach by supporting projects that have already completed the basic research and proof-of-concept phases.&amp;nbsp;With technologies that are one to three years away from commercialization, grantees work on identifying their potential markets and learn to focus on how their technology can meet the needs of future customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ingenuity thrives at MIT, driving inventions that can be translated into real-world applications for widespread adoption, implantation, and use,” says J-WAFS Director Professor John H. Lienhard V. “But successful commercialization of MIT technology requires engineers to focus on many challenges beyond making the technology work. MIT’s I&amp;amp;E network offers a variety of programs that help researchers develop technology readiness, investigate markets, conduct customer discovery, and initiate product design and development,” Lienhard adds.&amp;nbsp;“With this strong I&amp;amp;E framework, many J-WAFS Solutions teams have established startup companies by the completion of the grant.&amp;nbsp;J-WAFS-supported technologies have had powerful, positive effects on human welfare. Together, the J-WAFS Solutions program and MIT’s I&amp;amp;E ecosystem demonstrate how academic research can evolve into business innovations that make a better world,” Lienhard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating I&amp;amp;E collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to support for furthering research, J-WAFS Solutions grants allow faculty, students, postdocs, and research staff to learn the fundamentals of how to transform their work into commercial products and companies. As part of the grant requirements, researchers must interact with mentors through MIT Venture Mentoring Service (VMS). VMS connects MIT entrepreneurs with teams of carefully selected professionals who provide free and confidential mentorship, guidance, and other services to help advance ideas into for-profit, for-benefit, or nonprofit ventures. Since 2000, VMS has mentored over 4,600 MIT entrepreneurs across all industries, through a dynamic and accomplished group of nearly 200 mentors who volunteer their time so that others may succeed. The mentors provide impartial and unbiased advice to members of the MIT community, including MIT alumni in the Boston area. J-WAFS Solutions teams have been guided by 21 mentors from numerous companies and nonprofits. Mentors often attend project events and progress meetings throughout the grant period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working with VMS has provided me and my organization with a valuable sounding board for a range of topics, big and small,” says Eric Verploegen PhD ’08, former research engineer in the MIT D-Lab and founder of J-WAFS spinout &lt;a href="https://www.coolveg.org/"&gt;CoolVeg&lt;/a&gt;. Along with professors Leon Glicksman and Daniel Frey, Verploegen received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021 to commercialize cold-storage chambers that use evaporative cooling to help farmers preserve fruits and vegetables in rural off-grid communities. Verploegen started CoolVeg in 2022 to increase access and adoption of open-source, evaporative cooling technologies through collaborations with businesses, research institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and government agencies. “Working as a solo founder at my nonprofit venture, it is always great to have avenues to get feedback on communications approaches, overall strategy, and operational issues that my mentors have experience with,” Verploegen says. Three years after the initial Solutions grant, one of the VMS mentors assigned to the evaporative cooling team still acts as a mentor to Verploegen today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Solutions grant requirement is for teams to participate in the Spark program — a free, three-week course that provides an entry point for researchers to explore the potential value of their innovation. Spark is part of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which is an “immersive, entrepreneurial training program that facilitates the transformation of invention to impact.” In 2018, MIT received an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-selected-ninth-nsf-innovation-corps-node-new-england-0904"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; from the NSF, establishing the New England Regional Innovation Corps Node (NE I-Corps) to deliver I-Corps training to participants across New England. Trainings are open to researchers, engineers, scientists, and others who want to engage in a customer discovery process for their technology. Offered regularly throughout the year, the Spark course helps participants identify markets and explore customer needs in order to understand how their technologies can be positioned competitively in their target markets. They learn to assess barriers to adoption, as well as potential regulatory issues or other challenges to commercialization. NE-I-Corps reports that since its start, over 1,200 researchers from MIT have completed the program and have gone on to launch 175 ventures, raising over $3.3 billion in funding from grants and investors, and creating over 1,800 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantinos Katsimpouras, a research scientist in the Department of Chemical Engineering, went through the NE I-Corps Spark program to better understand the customer base for a technology he developed with&amp;nbsp;professors Gregory Stephanopoulos and Anthony Sinskey.&amp;nbsp;The group received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021&amp;nbsp;for their microbial platform that converts food waste from the dairy industry into valuable products.&amp;nbsp;“As a scientist with no prior experience in entrepreneurship, the program introduced me to important concepts and tools for conducting customer interviews and adopting a new mindset,” notes Katsimpouras. “Most importantly, it encouraged me to get out of the building and engage in interviews with potential customers and stakeholders, providing me with invaluable insights and a deeper understanding of my industry,” he adds. These interviews also helped connect the team with companies willing to provide resources to test and improve their technology — a critical step to the scale-up of any lab invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Professor Cem Tasan’s research group in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the I-Corps program led them to the J-WAFS Solutions grant, instead of the other way around. Tasan is currently working with postdoc Onur Guvenc on a J-WAFS Solutions project to manufacture formable sheet metal by consolidating steel scrap without melting, thereby reducing water use compared to traditional steel processing. Before applying for the Solutions grant, Guvenc took part in NE I-Corps. Like Katsimpouras, Guvenc benefited from the interaction with industry. “This program required me to step out of the lab and engage with potential customers, allowing me to learn about their immediate challenges and test my initial assumptions about the market,” Guvenc recalls. “My interviews with industry professionals also made me aware of the connection between water consumption and steelmaking processes, which ultimately led to the J-WAFS 2023 Solutions Grant,” says Guvenc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the Spark program, participants may be eligible to apply for the Fusion program, which provides microgrants of up to $1,500 to conduct further customer discovery. The Fusion program is self-paced, requiring teams to conduct 12 additional customer interviews and craft a final presentation summarizing their key learnings. Professor Patrick Doyle’s J-WAFS Solutions team completed the Spark and Fusion programs at MIT. Most recently, their team was accepted to join the NSF I-Corps National program with a $50,000 award. The intensive program requires teams to complete an additional 100 customer discovery interviews over seven weeks. Located in the Department of Chemical Engineering, the Doyle lab is working on a sustainable microparticle hydrogel system to rapidly remove micropollutants from water. The team’s focus has expanded to higher value purifications in amino acid and biopharmaceutical manufacturing applications. Devashish Gokhale PhD ’24 worked with Doyle on much of the underlying science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our platform technology could potentially be used for selective separations in very diverse market segments, ranging from individual consumers to large industries and government bodies with varied use-cases,” Gokhale explains. He goes on to say, “The I-Corps Spark program added significant value by providing me with an effective framework to approach this problem ... I was assigned a mentor who provided critical feedback, teaching me how to formulate effective questions and identify promising opportunities.” Gokhale says that by the end of Spark, the team was able to identify the best target markets for their products. He also says that the program provided valuable seminars on topics like intellectual property, which was helpful in subsequent discussions the team had with MIT’s Technology Licensing Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another member of Doyle’s team, Arjav Shah, a recent PhD from MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering and a current MBA candidate at the MIT Sloan School of Management, is spearheading the team’s commercialization plans. Shah attended Fusion last fall and hopes to lead efforts to incorporate a startup company called hydroGel.&amp;nbsp; “I admire the hypothesis-driven approach of the I-Corps program,” says Shah. “It has enabled us to identify our customers’ biggest pain points, which will hopefully lead us to finding a product-market fit.” He adds “based on our learnings from the program, we have been able to pivot to impact-driven, higher-value applications in the food processing and biopharmaceutical industries.” Postdoc Luca Mazzaferro will lead the technical team at hydroGel alongside Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a different project, Qinmin Zheng, a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, is working with Professor Andrew Whittle and Lecturer Fábio Duarte. Zheng plans to take the Fusion course this fall to advance their J-WAFS Solutions project that aims to commercialize a novel sensor to quantify the relative abundance of major algal species and provide early detection of harmful algal blooms. After completing Spark, Zheng says he’s “excited to participate in the Fusion program, and potentially the National I-Corps program, to further explore market opportunities and minimize risks in our future product development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and societal benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercializing technologies developed at MIT is one of the ways J-WAFS helps ensure that MIT research advances will have real-world impacts in water and food systems. Since its inception, the J-WAFS Solutions program has awarded 28 grants (including renewals), which have supported 19 projects that address a wide range of global water and food challenges. The program has distributed over $4 million to 24 professors, 11 research staff, 15 postdocs, and 30 students across MIT. Nearly half of all J-WAFS Solutions projects have resulted in spinout companies or commercialized products, including eight companies to date plus two open-source technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nona-technologies.com/"&gt;Nona Technologies&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a J-WAFS spinout that is helping the world by developing new approaches to produce freshwater for drinking. Desalination — the process of removing salts from seawater — typically requires a large-scale technology called reverse osmosis. But Nona created a desalination device that can work in remote off-grid locations.&amp;nbsp;By separating salt and bacteria from water using electric current through a process called ion concentration polarization (ICP), their technology also reduces overall energy consumption. The novel method was developed by Jongyoon Han, professor of electrical engineering and biological engineering, and research scientist Junghyo Yoon. Along with Bruce Crawford, a Sloan MBA alum, Han and Yoon created Nona Technologies to bring their lightweight, energy-efficient desalination technology to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My feeling early on was that once you have technology, commercialization will take care of itself,” admits Crawford. The team completed both the Spark and Fusion programs and quickly realized that much more work would be required. “Even in our first 24 interviews, we learned that the two first markets we envisioned would not be viable in the near term, and we also got our first hints at the beachhead we ultimately selected,” says Crawford. Nona Technologies has since won MIT’s $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, received media attention from outlets like &lt;em&gt;Newsweek &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, and hired a team that continues to further the technology for deployment in resource-limited areas where clean drinking water may be scarce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-borne diseases sicken millions of people worldwide each year, but J-WAFS researchers are addressing this issue by integrating molecular engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence to revolutionize food pathogen testing. Professors Tim Swager and Alexander Klibanov, of the Department of Chemistry, were awarded one of the first J-WAFS Solutions grants for their sensor that targets food safety pathogens. The sensor uses specialized droplets that behave like a dynamic lens, changing in the presence of target bacteria in order to detect dangerous bacterial contamination in food. In 2018, Swager launched &lt;a href="https://www.xibus.systems/"&gt;Xibus Systems Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to bring the sensor to market and advance food safety for greater public health, sustainability, and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our involvement with the J-WAFS Solutions Program has been vital,” says Swager. “It has provided us with a bridge between the academic world and the business world and allowed us to perform more detailed work to create a usable application,” he adds. In 2022, Xibus developed a product called XiSafe, which enables the detection of contaminants like salmonella and listeria faster and with higher sensitivity than other food testing products. The innovation could save food processors billions of dollars worldwide and prevent thousands of food-borne fatalities annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS Solutions companies have raised nearly $66 million in venture capital and other funding. Just this past June, J-WAFS spinout SiTration announced that it raised an $11.8 million seed round. Jeffrey Grossman, a professor in MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, was another early J-WAFS Solutions grantee for his work on low-cost energy-efficient filters for desalination. The project enabled the development of nanoporous membranes and resulted in two spinout companies, &lt;a href="https://viaseparations.com/"&gt;Via Separations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sitration.com/"&gt;SiTration&lt;/a&gt;. SiTration was co-founded by Brendan Smith PhD ’18, who was a part of the original J-WAFS team. Smith is CEO of the company and has overseen the advancement of the membrane technology, which has gone on to reduce cost and resource consumption in industrial wastewater treatment, advanced manufacturing, and resource extraction of materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel from recycled electric vehicle batteries. The company also recently announced that it is working with the mining company Rio Tinto to handle harmful wastewater generated at mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not just J-WAFS spinout companies that are producing real-world results. Products like the ECC Vial — a portable, low-cost method for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; detection in water — have been brought to the market and helped thousands of people. The test kit was developed by MIT D-Lab Lecturer Susan Murcott and Professor Jeffrey Ravel of the MIT History Section. The duo received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2018 to promote safely managed drinking water and improved public health in Nepal, where it is difficult to identify which wells are contaminated by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. By the end of their grant period, the team had manufactured approximately 3,200 units, of which 2,350 were distributed — enough to help 12,000 people in Nepal. The researchers also trained local Nepalese on best manufacturing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important, in my life experience, to follow your dream and to serve others,” says Murcott. Economic success is important to the health of any venture, whether it’s a company or a product, but equally important is the social impact — a philosophy that J-WAFS research strives to uphold. “Do something because it’s worth doing and because it changes people’s lives and saves lives,” Murcott adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS prepares to celebrate its 10th anniversary this year, we look forward to continued collaboration with MIT’s many I&amp;amp;E programs to advance knowledge and develop solutions that will have tangible effects on the world’s water and food systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions program&lt;/a&gt; and about &lt;a href="https://facts.mit.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/"&gt;innovation and entrepreneurship at MIT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>David L. Chandler | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Water contamination by the chemicals used in today’s technology is a rapidly growing problem globally. A recent&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-018-0094-1" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control found that 98 percent of people tested had detectable levels of PFAS, a family of particularly long-lasting compounds also known as “forever chemicals,” in their bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new filtration material developed by researchers at MIT might provide a nature-based solution to this stubborn contamination issue. The material, based on natural silk and cellulose, can remove a wide variety of these persistent chemicals as well as heavy metals. And, its antimicrobial properties can help keep the filters from fouling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.4c07409" target="_blank"&gt;described in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a paper by MIT postdoc Yilin Zhang, professor of civil and environmental engineering Benedetto Marelli, and four others from MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS chemicals are present in a wide range of products, including cosmetics, food packaging, water-resistant clothing, firefighting foams, and antistick coating for cookware. A recent &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00502" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; identified 57,000 sites contaminated by these chemicals in the U.S. alone. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that PFAS remediation will cost $1.5 billion per year, in order to meet&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-141/subpart-Z?toc=1" target="_blank"&gt;new regulations&lt;/a&gt; that call for limiting the compound to less than 7 parts per trillion in drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contamination by PFAS and similar compounds “is actually a very big deal, and current solutions may only partially resolve this problem very efficiently or economically,” Zhang says. “That’s why we came up with this protein and cellulose-based, fully natural solution,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We came to the project by chance,” Marelli notes. The initial technology that made the filtration material possible was developed by his group for a completely unrelated purpose — as a way to make a labelling system to counter the spread of counterfeit seeds, which are often of inferior quality. His team devised a way of processing silk proteins into uniform nanoscale crystals, or “nanofibrils,” through an environmentally benign, water-based drop-casting method at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang suggested that their new nanofibrillar material might be effective at filtering contaminants, but initial attempts with the silk nanofibrils alone didn’t work. The team decided to try adding another material: cellulose, which is abundantly available and can be obtained from agricultural wood pulp waste. The researchers used a self-assembly method in which the silk fibroin protein is suspended in water and then templated into nanofibrils by inserting “seeds” of cellulose nanocrystals. This causes the previously disordered silk molecules to line up together along the seeds, forming the basis of a hybrid material with distinct new properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By integrating cellulose into the silk-based fibrils that could be formed into a thin membrane, and then tuning the electrical charge of the cellulose, the researchers produced a material that was highly effective at removing contaminants in lab tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electrical charge of the cellulose, they found, also gave it strong antimicrobial properties. This is a significant advantage, since one of the primary causes of failure in filtration membranes is fouling by bacteria and fungi. The antimicrobial properties of this material should greatly reduce that fouling issue, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These materials can really compete with the current standard materials in water filtration when it comes to extracting metal ions and these emerging contaminants, and they can also outperform some of them currently,” Marelli says. In lab tests, the materials were able to extract orders of magnitude more of the contaminants from water than the currently used standard materials, activated carbon or granular activated carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the new work serves as a proof of principle, Marelli says, the team plans to continue working on improving the material, especially in terms of durability and availability of source materials. While the silk proteins used can be available as a byproduct of the silk textile industry, if this material were to be scaled up to address the global needs for water filtration, the supply might be insufficient. Also, alternative protein materials may turn out to perform the same function at lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the material would likely be used as a point-of-use filter, something that could be attached to a kitchen faucet, Zhang says. Eventually, it could be scaled up to provide filtration for municipal water supplies, but only after testing demonstrates that this would not pose any risk of introducing any contamination into the water supply. But one big advantage of the material, he says, is that both the silk and the cellulose constituents are considered food-grade substances, so any contamination is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the normal materials available today are focusing on one class of contaminants or solving single problems,” Zhang says. “I think we are among the first to address all of these simultaneously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I love about this approach is that it is using only naturally grown materials like silk and cellulose to fight pollution,” says Hannes Schniepp, professor of applied science at the College of William and Mary, who was not associated with this work. “In competing approaches, synthetic materials are used — which usually require only more chemistry to fight some of the adverse outcomes that chemistry has produced. [This work] breaks this cycle! ... If this can be mass-produced in an economically viable way, this could really have a major impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team included MIT postdocs Hui Sun and Meng Li, graduate student Maxwell Kalinowski, and recent graduate Yunteng Cao PhD ’22, now a postdoc at Yale University. The work was supported by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets and intermittent fasting have been shown to have numerous health benefits: They can delay the onset of some age-related diseases&amp;nbsp;and lengthen lifespan, not only in humans but many other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many complex mechanisms underlie this phenomenon. Previous work from MIT has shown that one way fasting exerts its beneficial effects is by boosting the regenerative abilities of intestinal stem cells, which helps the intestine recover from injuries or inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of mice, MIT researchers have now identified the pathway that enables this enhanced regeneration, which is activated once the mice begin “refeeding” after the fast. They also found a downside to this regeneration: When cancerous mutations occurred during the regenerative period, the mice were more likely to develop early-stage intestinal tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having more stem cell activity is good for regeneration, but too much of a good thing over time can have less favorable consequences,” says Omer Yilmaz, an MIT associate professor of biology, a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and the senior author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yilmaz adds that further studies are needed before forming any conclusion as to whether fasting has a similar effect in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still have a lot to learn, but it is interesting that being in either the state of fasting or refeeding when exposure to mutagen occurs can have a profound impact on the likelihood of developing a cancer in these well-defined mouse models,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT postdocs Shinya Imada and Saleh Khawaled are the lead authors of the paper, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07840-z" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several years, Yilmaz’s lab has been investigating how fasting and low-calorie diets affect intestinal health. In a 2018 &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/fasting-boosts-stem-cells-regenerative-capacity-0503" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, his team reported that during a fast, intestinal stem cells begin to use lipids as an energy source, instead of carbohydrates. They also showed that fasting led to a significant boost in stem cells’ regenerative ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, unanswered questions remained: How does fasting trigger this boost in regenerative ability, and when does the regeneration begin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since that paper, we’ve really been focused on understanding what is it about fasting that drives regeneration,” Yilmaz says. “Is it fasting itself that’s driving regeneration, or eating after the fast?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the researchers found that stem cell regeneration is suppressed during fasting but then surges&amp;nbsp;during the refeeding period. The researchers followed three groups of mice — one that fasted for 24 hours, another one that fasted for 24 hours and then was allowed to eat whatever they wanted during a 24-hour refeeding period, and a control group that ate whatever they wanted throughout the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed intestinal stem cells’ ability to proliferate at different time points and found that the stem cells showed the highest levels of proliferation at the end of the 24-hour refeeding period. These cells were also more proliferative than intestinal stem cells from mice that had not fasted at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that fasting and refeeding represent two distinct states,” Imada says. “In the fasted state, the ability of cells to use lipids and fatty acids as an energy source enables them to survive when nutrients are low. And then it’s the postfast refeeding state that really drives the regeneration. When nutrients become available, these stem cells and progenitor cells activate programs that enable them to build cellular mass and repopulate the intestinal lining.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies revealed that these cells activate a cellular signaling pathway known as mTOR, which is involved in cell growth and metabolism. One of mTOR’s roles is to regulate the translation of messenger RNA into protein, so when it’s activated, cells produce more protein. This protein synthesis is essential for stem cells to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that mTOR activation in these stem cells also led to production of large quantities of polyamines — small molecules that help cells to grow and divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the refed state, you’ve got more proliferation, and you need to build cellular mass. That requires more protein, to build new cells, and those stem cells go on to build more differentiated cells or specialized intestinal cell types that line the intestine,” Khawaled says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much of a good thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that when stem cells are in this highly regenerative state, they are more prone to become cancerous. Intestinal stem cells are among the most actively dividing cells in the body, as they help the lining of the intestine completely turn over every five to 10 days. Because they divide so frequently, these stem cells are the most common source of precancerous cells in the intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers discovered that if they turned on a cancer-causing gene in the mice during the refeeding stage, they were much more likely to develop precancerous polyps than if the gene was turned on during the fasting state. Cancer-linked mutations that occurred during the refeeding state were also much more likely to produce polyps than mutations that occurred in mice that did not undergo the cycle of fasting and refeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to emphasize that this was all done in mice, using very well-defined cancer mutations. In humans it’s going to be a much more complex state,” Yilmaz says. “But it does lead us to the following notion: Fasting is very healthy, but if you’re unlucky and you’re refeeding after a fasting, and you get exposed to a mutagen, like a charred steak or something, you might actually be increasing your chances of developing a lesion that can go on to give rise to cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yilmaz also noted that the regenerative benefits of fasting could be significant for people who undergo radiation treatment, which can damage the intestinal lining, or other types of intestinal injury. His lab is now studying whether polyamine supplements could help to stimulate this kind of regeneration, without the need to fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This fascinating study provides insights into the complex interplay between food consumption, stem cell biology, and cancer risk,” says Ophir Klein, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. “Their work lays a foundation for testing polyamines as compounds that may augment intestinal repair after injuries, and it suggests that careful consideration is needed when planning diet-based strategies for regeneration to avoid increasing cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by Pew-Stewart Scholars Program for Cancer Research award, the MIT Stem Cell Initiative, the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program via the Kathy and Curt Marble Cancer Research Fund, and the Bridge Project, a partnership between the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT D-Lab students and instructors are improving the efficacy and economics of a brooder technology for newborn chicks that utilizes a practical, local resource: beeswax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed through participatory design with agricultural partners in Cameroon, their Off-Grid Brooder is a solution aimed at improving the profitability of the African nation’s small- and medium-scale poultry farms. Since it is common for smallholders in places with poor electricity supply to tend open fires overnight to keep chicks warm, the invention might also let farmers catch up on their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The target is eight hours. If farmers can sustain the warmth for eight hours, then they get to sleep,” says D-Lab instructor and former student Ahmad (Zak) Zakka SM ’23, who traveled to Cameroon in May to work on implementing brooder improvements tested at the D-Lab, along with D-Lab students, collaborators from African Solar Generation (ASG), and the African Diaspora Council of Switzerland – Branch Cameroon (CDAS–BC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poultry farming is heavily concentrated in lower- and middle-income countries, where it is an important component of rural economies and provides an inexpensive source of protein for residents. Raising chickens is fraught with economic risk, however, largely because it is hard for small-scale farmers to keep newborn chicks warm enough to survive (33 to 35 degrees Celsius, or 91 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on age). After the cost of feed, firewood used to heat the chick space is the biggest input for rural poultry farmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to D-Lab researchers, an average smallholder in Cameroon using traditional brooding methods spends $17 per month on firewood, achieves a 10 percent profit margin, and experiences chick mortality that can be as high as a total loss due to overheating or insufficient heat. The Off-Grid Brooder is designed to replace open fires with inexpensive, renewable, and locally available beeswax — a phase-change material used to make thermal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASG initially developed a brooder technology, the SolarBox, that used photovoltaic panels and electric batteries to power incandescent bulbs. While this provided effective heating, it was prohibitively expensive and difficult to maintain. In 2020, students from the D-Lab Energy class took on the challenge of reducing the cost and complexity of the SolarBox heating system to make it more accessible to small farmers in Cameroon. Through participatory design — a collaborative approach that involves all stakeholders in early stages of the design process — the team discovered a unique solution. Beeswax stored in a used glass container (such as a mayonnaise jar) is melted using a double boiler over a fire and then installed inside insulated brooder boxes alongside the chicks. As the beeswax cools and solidifies, it releases heat for several hours, keeping the brooder within the temperature range that chicks need to grow and develop. Farmers can then recharge the cooled wax batteries and repeat the process again and again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The big challenge was how to get heat,” says D-Lab Research Scientist Daniel Sweeney, who, with Zakka, co-teaches two D-Lab classes, 2.651/EC.711 (Introduction to Energy in Global Development), and 2.652/EC.712 (Applications of Energy in Global Development). “Decoupling the heat supplied by biomass (wood) from the heat the chicks need at night in the brooder, that’s the core of the innovation here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D-Lab instructors, researchers, and students have tested and tuned the system with partners in Cameroon. A research box constructed during a D-Lab trip to Cameroon in January 2023 worked well, but was “very expensive to build,” Zakka says. “The research box was a proof of concept in the field. The next step was to figure out how to make it affordable,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new brooder box, made entirely of locally sourced recycled materials at 5 percent of the cost of the research prototype, was developed during D-Lab’s January 2024 trip to Cameroon. Designed and produced in collaboration with CDAS-BC, the new brooder is much more affordable, but its functionality still needs fine-tuning. From late-May through mid-June, the D-Lab team, led by Zakka, worked with Cameroonian collaborators to improve the system again. This time, they assessed the efficacy of using straw, a readily available and low-cost material, arranged in panels to insulate the brooder box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team was hosted by CDAS-BC, including its president and founder Carole Erlemann Mengue and secretary and treasurer Kathrin Witschi, who operate an organic poultry farm in Afambassi, Cameroon. “The students will experiment with the box and try to improve the insulation of the box without neglecting that the chicks will need ventilation,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the CDAS-BC partners say that they hoped to explore increasing the number of chicks that the box can keep warm. “If the system could heat 500 to 1,000 chicks at a time,” they note, “it would help farmers save firewood, to sleep through the night, and to minimize the risk of fire in the building and the risk of stepping on chicks while replacing firewood.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this spring, Erlemann Mengue and Witschi tested the low-cost Off-Grid Brooder Box, which can hold 30 to 40 chicks in its current design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were very interested in partnering with us to evaluate the technology. They are running the tests and doing a lot of technical measurement to track the temperature inside the brooder over time,” says Sweeney, adding that the CDAS-BC partners are amassing datasets that they send to the MIT D-Lab team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney and Zakka, along with PhD candidate Aly Kombargi, who worked on the research box in Cameroon last year, hope to not only improve the functionality of the Off-Grid Poultry Brooder but also broaden its use beyond Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal of our trip was to have a working prototype, and the goal since then has been to scale this up,” Kombargi says. “It’s absolutely scalable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurring that “the technology should work across developing countries in small-scale poultry sectors,” Zakka says this spring’s D-Lab trip included workshops for area poultry farmers to teach them about benefits of the Off-Grid Brooder and how to make their own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m excited to see if we can get people excited about pushing this as a business … to see if they would build and sell it to other people in the community,” Zakka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds Sweeney, “This isn’t rocket science. If we have some guidance and some open-source information we could share, I’m pretty sure (farmers) could put them together on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, he says, partners identified through MIT’s networks in Zambia and Uganda are building their own brooders based on the D-Lab design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), which supports research, innovation, and cross-disciplinary collaborations involving water and food systems, awarded the Off-Grid Brooder project a $25,000 research and development grant in 2022. The program is “pleased that the project’s approach was grounded in engagement with MIT students and community collaborators,” says Executive Director Renee J. Robins ’83. “The participatory design process helped produce innovative prototypes that are already making positive impacts for smallholder poultry farmers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That process and the very real impact on communities in Cameroon is what draws students to the project and keeps them committed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney says a recent D-Lab design review for the chick brooder highlighted that the project continued to attract the attention and curiosity of students who participated in earlier stages and still want to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s something about this project. There’s this whole tribe of students that are still active on the broader project,” he says. “There’s something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The MIT School of Science is launching&amp;nbsp;a center&amp;nbsp;to advance knowledge and computational capabilities in the field of sustainability science, and support decision-makers in government, industry, and civil society to achieve sustainable development goals. Aligned with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://president.mit.edu/writing-speeches/announcing-climate-project-mit" target="_self"&gt;the Climate Project at MIT&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the MIT Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy will develop and apply expertise from across the Institute to improve understanding of sustainability challenges, and thereby provide actionable knowledge and insight to inform strategies for improving human well-being for current and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://idss.mit.edu/staff/noelle-selin/"&gt;Noelle Selin&lt;/a&gt;, professor at MIT’s Institute for Data, Systems and Society and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, will serve as the center’s inaugural faculty director.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/schlosser-c-adam"&gt;C. Adam Schlosser&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey"&gt;Sergey Paltsev&lt;/a&gt;, senior research scientists at MIT, will serve as deputy directors, with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/slinn-anne"&gt;Anne Slinn&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as executive director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating and succeeding both the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cgcs.mit.edu/"&gt;Center for Global Change Science&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://globalchange.mit.edu/"&gt;Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change&lt;/a&gt; while adding new capabilities, the center aims to produce leading-edge research to help guide societal transitions toward a more sustainable future. Drawing on the long history of MIT’s efforts to address global change and its integrated environmental and human dimensions, the center is well-positioned to lead burgeoning global efforts to advance the field of sustainability science, which seeks to understand nature-society systems in their full complexity. This understanding is designed to be relevant and actionable for decision-makers in government, industry, and civil society in their efforts to develop viable pathways to improve quality of life for multiple stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As critical challenges such as climate, health, energy, and food security increasingly affect people’s lives around the world, decision-makers need a better understanding of the earth in its full complexity — and that includes people, technologies, and institutions as well as environmental processes,” says Selin. “Better knowledge of these systems and how they interact can lead to more effective strategies that avoid unintended consequences and ensure an improved quality of life for all.”&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancing knowledge, computational capability, and decision support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To produce more precise and comprehensive knowledge of sustainability challenges and guide decision-makers to formulate more effective strategies, the center has set the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance fundamental understanding of the complex interconnected physical and socio-economic systems that affect human well-being.&lt;/strong&gt; As new policies and technologies are developed amid climate and other global changes, they interact with environmental processes and institutions in ways that can alter the earth’s critical life-support systems. Fundamental mechanisms that determine many of these systems’ behaviors, including those related to interacting climate, water, food, and socio-economic systems, remain largely unknown and poorly quantified. Better understanding can help society mitigate the risks of abrupt changes and “tipping points” in these systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop, establish and disseminate new computational tools&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;toward better understanding earth systems&lt;/strong&gt;, including both environmental and human dimensions. The center’s work will integrate modeling and data analysis across disciplines in an era of increasing volumes of observational data. MIT multi-system models and data products will provide robust information to inform decision-making and shape the next generation of sustainability science and strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Produce actionable science that supports equity and justice within and across generations&lt;/strong&gt;. The center’s research will be designed to inform action associated with measurable outcomes aligned with supporting human well-being across generations. This requires engaging a broad range of stakeholders, including not only nations and companies, but also nongovernmental organizations and communities that take action to promote sustainable development — with special attention to those who have historically borne the brunt of environmental injustice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The center’s work will advance fundamental understanding in sustainability science, leverage leading-edge computing and data, and promote engagement and impact,” says Selin. “Our researchers will help lead scientists and strategists across the globe who share MIT’s commitment to mobilizing knowledge to inform action toward a more sustainable world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a better world at MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on existing MIT capabilities in sustainability science and strategy, the center aims to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;focus research, education, and outreach under a theme that reflects a comprehensive state of the field and international research directions, fostering a dynamic community of students, researchers, and faculty;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;raise the visibility of sustainability science at MIT, emphasizing links between science and action, in the context of existing Institute goals and other efforts on climate and sustainability, and in a way that reflects the vital contributions of a range of natural and social science disciplines to understanding human-environment systems; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;re-emphasize MIT’s long-standing expertise in integrated systems modeling while leveraging the Institute’s concurrent leading-edge strengths in data and computing, establishing leadership that harnesses recent innovations, including those in machine learning and artificial intelligence, toward addressing the science challenges of global change and sustainability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy will provide the necessary synergy for our MIT researchers to develop, deploy, and scale up serious solutions to climate change and other critical sustainability challenges,” says Nergis Mavalvala, the Curtis and Kathleen Marble Professor of Astrophysics and dean of the MIT School of Science. “With Professor Selin at its helm, the center will also ensure that these solutions are created in concert with the people who are directly affected now and in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center builds on more than three decades of achievements by the Center for Global Change Science and the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, both of which were directed or co-directed by professor of atmospheric science &lt;a href="https://globalchange.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/prinn-ronald" target="_blank"&gt;Ronald Prinn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The next time you cook pasta, imagine that you are cooking spaghetti, rigatoni, and seven other varieties all together, and they need to be separated onto 10 different plates before serving. A colander can remove the water — but you still have a mound of unsorted noodles.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now imagine that this had to be done for thousands of tons of pasta a day. That gives you an idea of the scale of the problem facing Brendan Smith PhD ’18, co-founder and CEO of SiTration, a startup formed out of MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE) in 2020.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;SiTration, which raised $11.8 million in seed capital led by venture capital firm 2150 earlier this month, is revolutionizing the extraction and refining of copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium, precious metals, and other materials critical to manufacturing clean-energy technologies such as electric motors, wind turbines, and batteries. Its initial target applications are recovering the materials from complex mining feed streams, spent lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles, and various metals refining processes.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The company’s breakthrough lies in a new silicon membrane technology that can be adjusted to efficiently recover disparate materials, providing a more sustainable and economically viable alternative to conventional, chemically intensive processes. Think of a colander with adjustable pores to strain different types of pasta. SiTration’s technology has garnered interest from industry players, including mining giant Rio Tinto.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Some observers may question whether targeting such different industries could cause the company to lose focus. “But when you dig into these markets, you discover there is actually a significant overlap in how all of these materials are recovered, making it possible for a single solution to have impact across verticals,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powering up materials recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional methods of extracting critical materials in mining, refining, and recycling lithium-ion batteries involve heavy use of chemicals and heat, which harm the environment. Typically, raw ore from mines or spent batteries are ground into fine particles before being dissolved in acid or incinerated in a furnace. Afterward, they undergo intensive chemical processing to separate and purify the valuable materials.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“It requires as much as 10 tons of chemical input to produce one ton of critical material recovered from the mining or battery recycling feedstock,” says Smith. Operators can then sell the recaptured materials back into the supply chain, but suffer from wide swings in profitability due to uncertain market prices. Lithium prices have been the most volatile, having surged more than 400 percent before tumbling back to near-original levels in the past two years. Despite their poor economics and negative environmental impact, these processes remain the state of the art today.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;By contrast, SiTration is electrifying the critical-materials recovery process, improving efficiency, producing less chemical waste, and reducing the use of chemicals and heat. What’s more, the company’s processing technology is built to be highly adaptable, so it can handle all kinds of materials.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The core technology is based on work done at MIT to develop a novel type of membrane made from silicon, which is durable enough to withstand harsh chemicals and high temperatures while conducting electricity. It’s also highly tunable, meaning it can be modified or adjusted to suit different conditions or target specific materials.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;SiTration’s technology also incorporates electro-extraction, a technique that uses electrochemistry to further isolate and extract specific target materials. This powerful combination of methods in a single system makes it more efficient and effective at isolating and recovering valuable materials, Smith says. So depending on what needs to be separated or extracted, the filtration and electro-extraction processes are adjusted accordingly.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“We can produce membranes with pore sizes from the molecular scale up to the size of a human hair in diameter, and everything in between. Combined with the ability to electrify the membrane and separate based on a material’s electrochemical properties, this tunability allows us to target a vast array of different operations and separation applications across industrial fields,” says Smith.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Efficient access to materials like lithium, cobalt, and copper — and precious metals like platinum, gold, silver, palladium, and rare-earth elements — is key to unlocking innovation in business and sustainability as the world moves toward electrification and away from fossil fuels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is an era when new materials are critical,” says Professor Jeffrey Grossman, co-founder and chief scientist of SiTration and the Morton and Claire Goulder and Family Professor in Environmental Systems at DMSE. “For so many technologies, they’re both the bottleneck and the opportunity, offering tremendous potential for non-incremental advances. And the role they’re having in commercialization and in entrepreneurship cannot be overstated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SiTration’s commercial frontier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith became interested in separation technology in 2013 as a PhD student in Grossman’s DMSE research group, which has focused on the design of new membrane materials for a range of applications. The two shared a curiosity about separation of critical materials and a hunger to advance the technology. After years of study under Grossman’s mentorship, and with support from several MIT incubators and foundations including the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab’s Solutions Program, the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, the Kavanaugh Fellowship, MIT Sandbox, and Venture Mentoring Service, Smith was ready to officially form SiTration in 2020. Grossman has a seat on the board and plays an active role as a strategic and technical advisor.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Grossman is involved in several MIT spinoffs and embraces the different imperatives of research versus commercialization. “At SiTration, we’re driving this technology to work at scale. There’s something super exciting about that goal,” he says. “The challenges that come with scaling are very different than the challenges that come in a university lab.” At the same time, although not every research breakthrough becomes a commercial product, open-ended, curiosity-driven knowledge pursuit holds its own crucial value, he adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been rewarding for Grossman to see his technically gifted student and colleague develop a host of other skills the role of CEO demands. Getting out to the market and talking about the technology with potential partners, putting together a dynamic team, discovering the challenges facing industry, drumming up support, early on — those became the most pressing activities on Smith’s agenda.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“What’s most fun to me about being a CEO of an early-stage startup is that there are 100 different factors, most people-oriented, that you have to navigate every day. Each stakeholder has different motivations and objectives. And you basically try to fit that all together, to create value for our partners and customers, the company, and for society,” says Smith. “You start with just an idea, and you have to keep leveraging that to form a more and more tangible product, to multiply and progress commercial relationships, and do it all at an ever-expanding scale.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;MIT DNA runs deep in the nine-person company, with DMSE grad and former Grossman student Jatin Patil as director of product; Ahmed Helal, from MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, as vice president of research and development; Daniel Bregante, from the Department of Chemistry, as VP of technology; and Sarah Melvin, from the departments of Physics and Political Science, as VP of strategy and operations. Melvin is the first hire devoted to business development. Smith plans to continue expanding the team following the closing of the company’s seed round. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic alliances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a good communicator was important when it came to securing funding, Smith says. SiTration received $2.35 million in pre-seed funding in 2022 led by Azolla Ventures, which reserves its $239 million in investment capital for startups that would not otherwise easily obtain funding. “We invest only in solution areas that can achieve gigaton-scale climate impact by 2050,” says Matthew Nordan, a general partner at Azolla and now SiTration board member. The MIT-affiliated E14 Fund also contributed to the pre-seed round; Azolla and E14 both participated in the recent seed funding round.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“Brendan demonstrated an extraordinary ability to go from being a thoughtful scientist to a business leader and thinker who has punched way above his weight in engaging with customers and recruiting a well-balanced team and navigating tricky markets,” says Nordan.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One of SiTration’s first partnerships is with Rio Tinto, one of the largest mining companies in the world. As SiTration evaluated various uses cases in its early days, identifying critical materials as its target market, Rio Tinto was looking for partners to recover valuable metals such as cobalt and copper from the wastewater generated at mines. These metals were typically trapped in the water, creating harmful waste and resulting in lost revenue.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“We thought this was a great innovation challenge and posted it on our website to scout for companies to partner with who can help us solve this water challenge,” said Nick Gurieff, principal advisor for mine closure, in an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ilp.mit.edu/news/how-rfp-brought-two-companies-together-rio-tinto-and-sitration"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with MIT’s Industrial Liaison Program in 2023.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;At SiTration, mining was not yet a market focus, but Smith couldn’t help noticing that Rio Tinto’s needs were in alignment with what his young company offered. SiTration submitted its proposal in August 2022.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Gurieff said SiTration’s tunable membrane set it apart. The companies formed a business partnership in June 2023, with SiTration adjusting its membrane to handle mine wastewater and incorporating Rio Tinto feedback to refine the technology. After running tests with water from mine sites, SiTration will begin building a small-scale critical-materials recovery unit, followed by larger-scale systems processing up to 100 cubic meters of water an hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SiTration’s focused technology development with Rio Tinto puts it in a good position for future market growth, Smith says. “Every ounce of effort and resource we put into developing our product is geared towards creating real-world value. Having an industry-leading partner constantly validating our progress is a tremendous advantage.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a long time from the days when Smith began tinkering with tiny holes in silicon in Grossman’s DMSE lab. Now, they work together as business partners who are scaling up technology to meet a global need. Their joint passion for applying materials innovation to tough problems has served them well. “Materials science and engineering is an engine for a lot of the innovation that is happening today,” Grossman says. “When you look at all of the challenges we face to make the transition to a more sustainable planet, you realize how many of these are materials challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As they seep and calve into the sea, melting glaciers and ice sheets are raising global water levels at unprecedented rates. To predict and prepare for future sea-level rise, scientists need a better understanding of how fast glaciers melt and what influences their flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a study by MIT scientists offers a new picture of glacier flow, based on microscopic deformation in the ice. The results show that a glacier’s flow depends strongly on how microscopic defects move through the ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found they could estimate a glacier’s flow based on whether the ice is prone to microscopic defects of one kind versus another. They used this relationship between micro- and macro-scale deformation to develop a new model for how glaciers flow. With the new model, they mapped the flow of ice in locations across the Antarctic Ice Sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to conventional wisdom, they found, the ice sheet is not a monolith but instead is more varied in where and how it flows in response to warming-driven stresses. The study “dramatically alters the climate conditions under which marine ice sheets may become unstable and drive rapid rates of sea-level rise,” the researchers write in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study really shows the effect of microscale processes on macroscale behavior,” says Meghana Ranganathan PhD ’22, who led the study as a graduate student in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) and is now a postdoc at Georgia Tech. “These mechanisms happen at the scale of water molecules and ultimately can affect the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Broadly speaking, glaciers are accelerating, and there are a lot of variants around that,” adds co-author and EAPS Associate Professor Brent Minchew.&amp;nbsp;“This is the first study that takes a step from the laboratory to the ice sheets and starts evaluating what the stability of ice is in the natural environment. That will ultimately feed into our understanding of the probability of catastrophic sea-level rise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranganathan and Minchew’s study &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2309788121" target="_blank"&gt;appears this week&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glacier flow describes the movement of ice from the peak of a glacier, or the center of an ice sheet, down to the edges, where the ice then breaks off and melts into the ocean — a normally slow process that contributes over time to raising the world’s average sea level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the oceans have risen at unprecedented rates, driven by global warming and the accelerated melting of glaciers and ice sheets. While the loss of polar ice is known to be a major contributor to sea-level rise, it is also the biggest uncertainty when it comes to making predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of it’s a scaling problem,” Ranganathan explains. “A lot of the fundamental mechanisms that cause ice to flow happen at a really small scale that we can’t see. We wanted&amp;nbsp;to pin down exactly what these microphysical processes are that govern ice flow, which hasn’t been represented in models of sea-level change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s new study builds on previous experiments from the early 2000s by geologists at the University of Minnesota, who studied how small chips of ice deform when physically stressed and compressed. Their work revealed two microscopic mechanisms by which ice can flow: “dislocation creep,” where molecule-sized cracks migrate through the ice, and “grain boundary sliding,” where individual ice crystals slide against each other, causing the boundary between them to move through the ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geologists found that ice’s sensitivity to stress, or how likely it is to flow, depends on which of the two mechanisms is dominant. Specifically, ice is more sensitive to stress when microscopic defects occur via dislocation creep rather than grain boundary sliding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranganathan and Minchew realized that those findings at the microscopic level could redefine how ice flows at much larger, glacial scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current models for sea-level rise assume a single value for the sensitivity of ice to stress and hold this value constant across an entire ice sheet,” Ranganathan explains. “What these experiments showed was that actually, there’s quite a bit of variability in ice sensitivity, due to which of these mechanisms is at play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mapping match&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their new study, the MIT team took insights from the previous experiments and developed a model to estimate an icy region’s sensitivity to stress, which directly relates to how likely that ice is to flow. The model takes in information such as the ambient temperature, the average size of ice crystals, and the estimated mass of ice in the region, and calculates how much the ice is deforming by dislocation creep versus grain boundary sliding. Depending on which of the two mechanisms is dominant, the model then estimates the region’s sensitivity to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists fed into the model actual observations from various locations across the Antarctic Ice Sheet, where others had previously recorded data such as the local height of ice, the size of ice crystals, and the ambient temperature. Based on the model’s estimates, the team generated a map of ice sensitivity to stress across the Antarctic Ice Sheet. When they compared this map to satellite and field measurements taken of the ice sheet over time, they observed a close match, suggesting that the model could be used to accurately predict how glaciers and ice sheets will flow in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As climate change starts to thin glaciers, that could affect the sensitivity of ice to stress,” Ranganathan says. “The instabilities that we expect in Antarctica could be very different, and we can now capture those differences, using this model.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/sophia-chen-its-our-duty-make-world-better-through-empathy-patience-respect-0528</guid>
        <dc:creator>Nancy Adams | MIT D-Lab</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sophia Chen, a fifth-year senior double majoring in mechanical engineering and art and design, learned about &lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu"&gt;MIT D-Lab&lt;/a&gt; when she was a Florida middle schooler. She drove with her family from their home in Clearwater to Tampa to an MIT informational open house for prospective students. There, she heard about a moringa seed press that had been developed by D-Lab students. Those students, Kwami Williams ’12 and Emily Cunningham (a cross-registered Harvard University student), went on to found &lt;a href="https://moringaconnect.com/"&gt;MoringaConnect&lt;/a&gt; with a goal of increasing Ghanaian farmer incomes. Over the past 12 years, the company has done just that, sometimes by a factor of 10 or more, by selling to wholesalers and establishing their own line of moringa skin and hair care products, as well as nutritional supplements and teas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember getting chills,” says Sophia. “I was so in awe. MIT had always been my dream college growing up, but hearing this particular story truly cemented that dream. I even talked about D-Lab during my admissions interview. Once I came to MIT, I knew I had to take a D-Lab class — and now, at the end of my five years, I've taken four.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking four D-Lab classes during her undergraduate years may make Sophia exceptional, though not unusual. Of the nearly 4,000 enrollments in D-Lab classes over the past 22 years, as many as 20 percent took at least two classes, and many take three or more by the time the graduate. For Sophia, her D-Lab classes were a logical progression that both confirmed and expanded her career goals in global medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centering the role of project community partners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia’s first D-Lab class was 2.722J / EC.720 (&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/academics/classes/d-lab-design"&gt;D-Lab: Design&lt;/a&gt;). Like all D-Lab classes, D-Lab: Design is project-based and centers the knowledge and contributions of each project’s community partner. Her team worked with a group in Uganda called Safe Water Harvesters on a project aimed at creating a solar-powered atmospheric water harvester using desiccants. They focused on early research and development for the desiccant technology by running tests for vapor absorption. Safe Water Harvesters designed the parameters and goals of the project and collaborated with the students remotely throughout the semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe Water Harvesters’ role in the project was key to the project’s success. “At D-Lab, I learned the importance of understanding that solutions in international development must come from the voices and needs of people whom the intervention is trying to serve,” she says. “Some of the first questions we were taught to ask are ‘what materials and manufacturing processes are available?’ and ‘how is this technology going to be maintained by the community?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The link between water access and gender inequity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electing to join the water harvesting project in Uganda was no accident. The previous summer, Sophia had interned with a startup targeting the spread of cholera in developing areas by engineering a new type of rapid detection technology that would sample from users’ local water sources. From there, she joined Professor Amos Winter’s Global Engineering and Research (GEAR) Lab as an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program student and worked on a point-of-use desalination unit for households in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking EC.715 (&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/academics/classes/d-lab-water-sanitation-and-hygiene"&gt;D-Lab: Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene&lt;/a&gt;) was a logical next step for Sophia. “This class was life-changing,” she says. “I was already passionate about clean water access and global resource equity, but I quickly discovered the complexity of WASH not just as an issue of poverty but as an issue of gender.” She joined a project spearheaded by a classmate from Nepal, which aimed to address the social taboos surrounding menstruation among Nepalese schoolgirls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This class and project helped me realize that water insecurity and gender inequality — especially gender-based violence — ​are highly intertwined,” comments Sophia. This plays out in a variety of ways. Where there is poor sanitation infrastructure in schools, girls often miss classes or drop out altogether when menstruating. And where water is scarce, women and girls often walk miles to collect water to accommodate daily drinking, cooking, and hygiene needs. During this trek, they are vulnerable to assault and the pressure to engage in transactional sex at water access points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It became clear to me that women are disproportionately affected by water insecurity, and that water is key to understanding women’s empowerment,” comments Sophia, “and that I wanted to keep learning about the field of development and how it intersects with gender!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in fall 2023, Sophia took both 11.025/EC.701 (&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/academics/classes/d-lab-development"&gt;D-Lab: Development&lt;/a&gt;) and WGS.277/EC.718 (&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/academics/classes/d-lab-gender-development"&gt;D-Lab: Gender and Development)&lt;/a&gt;. In D-Lab: Development, her team worked with &lt;a href="https://tatirano.org/"&gt;Tatirano&lt;/a&gt;, a nongovernmental organization in Madagascar, to develop a vapor-condensing chamber for a water desalination system, a prototype they were able to test and iterate in Madagascar at the end of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting out into the world through D-Lab fieldwork&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fieldwork with D-Lab is an eye-opening experience that anyone could benefit from,” says Sophia. “It’s easy to get lost in the MIT and tech bubble. But there’s a whole world out there with people who live such different lives than many of us, and we can learn even more from them than we can from our psets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Sophia’s D-Lab: Gender and Development class, she worked with the &lt;a href="https://sepke.org/about-us/"&gt;Society Empowerment Project&lt;/a&gt; in Kenya, ultimately traveling there during MIT’s Independent Activities Period last January. In Kenya, she worked with her team to run a workshop with teen parents to identify risk factors prior to pregnancy and postpartum challenges, in order to then ideate and develop solutions such as social programs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through my fieldwork in Kenya and Madagascar,” says Sophia, “it became clear how important it is to create community-based solutions that are led and maintained by community members. Solutions need community input, leadership, and trust. Ultimately, this is the only way to have long-lasting, high-impact, sustainable change. One of my D-Lab trip leaders said that you cannot import solutions. I hope all engineers recognize the significance of this statement. It is our duty as engineers and scientists to make the world a better place while carrying values of empathy, patience, and respect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursuing passion and purpose at the intersection of medicine, technology, and policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduation in June, Sophia will be traveling to South Africa through MISTI Africa to help with a clinical trial and community outreach. She then intends to pursue a master's in global health and apply to medical school, with the goal of working in global health at the intersection of medicine, technology, and policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is no understatement to say that D-Lab has played a central role in helping me discover what I’m passionate about and what my purpose is in life,” she says. “I hope to dedicate my career towards solving global health inequity and gender inequality.” ​&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two MIT scholars, each with a strong entrepreneurial drive, have received 2024 Kavanaugh Fellowship awards, advancing their quest to turn pioneering research into profitable commercial enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://kavfellow.mit.edu/"&gt; Kavanaugh Translational Fellows Program&lt;/a&gt; gives scholars training to lead organizations that will bring their research to market. PhD candidates Grant Knappe and Arjav Shah are this year’s recipients. Knappe is developing a drug delivery platform for an emerging class of medicines called nucleic acid therapeutics. Shah is using hydrogel microparticles to clean up water polluted by heavy metals and other contaminants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knappe and Shah will begin their fellowship with years of entrepreneurial expertise under their belts. They’ve developed and refined their business plans through MIT’s innovation ecosystem, including the Sandbox, the Legatum Center, the Venture Mentoring Service, the National Science Foundation’s I-Corps Program, and Blueprint by The Engine. Now, the yearlong Kavanaugh Fellowship will give the scholars time to focus exclusively on testing their business plans and exercising decision-making skills — critical to startup success — with the guidance of MIT mentors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a testament to the support and direction they’ve received from the MIT community that their entrepreneurial aspirations have evolved and matured over time,” says Michael J. Cima, program director for the Kavanaugh program and the David H. Koch Professor of Engineering in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2016, the Kavanaugh program was instrumental in helping past fellows launch several robust startups, including low-carbon cement manufacturer Sublime Systems and SiTration, which is using a new type of filtration membrane to extract critical materials such as lithium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A safer way to deliver breakthrough medicines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nucleic acid therapeutics, including mRNA and CRISPR, are disrupting today’s clinical landscape thanks to their promise of targeting disease treatment according to genetic blueprints. But the first methods of delivering these molecules to the body used viruses as their transport, raising&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9876036/"&gt; patient safety concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans have figured out how to engineer certain viruses found in nature to deliver specific cargoes [for disease treatment],” says Knappe. “But because they look like viruses, the human immune system sees them as a danger signal and creates an immune reaction that can be harmful to patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the safety profile issues of viral delivery, researchers turned to non-viral technologies that use lipid nanoparticle technology, a mixture of different lipid-like materials, assembled into particles to protect the mRNA therapeutic from getting degraded before it reaches a cell of interest. “Because they don’t look like viruses there, the immune system generally tolerates them,” adds Knappe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent data show lipid nanoparticles can now target the lung, opening the potential for novel treatments of deadly cancers and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knappe’s work in MIT’s Bathe BioNanoLab focused on building such a non-viral delivery platform based on a different technology: nucleic acid nanoparticles, which combine the attractive components of both viral and non-viral systems. Knappe will spend his Kavanaugh Fellowship year developing proof-of-concept data for his drug delivery method and building the team and funding needed to commercialize the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PhD candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering (ChemE), Knappe was initially attracted to MIT because of its intellectual openness. “You can work with any faculty member in other departments. I wasn't restricted to the chemical engineering faculty,” says Knappe, whose supervisor, Professor Mark Bathe, is in the Department of Biological Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knappe, who is from New Jersey, welcomes the challenges that will come in his Kavanaugh year, including the need to pinpoint the right story that will convince venture capitalists and other funders to bet on his technology. Attracting talent is also top of mind. “How do you convince really talented people that have a lot of opportunities to work on what you work on? Building the first team is going to be critical,” he says. The network Knappe has been building in his years at MIT is paying dividends now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting “forever chemicals” in water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That network includes Shah. The two fellows met when they worked on the &lt;em&gt;MIT Science Policy Review&lt;/em&gt;, a student-run journal concerned with the intersection of science, technology, and policy. Knappe and Shah did not compete directly academically but used their biweekly coffee walks as a welcome sounding board. Naturally, they were pleased when they found out they had both been chosen for the Kavanaugh Fellowship. So far, they have been too busy to celebrate over a beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are good collaborators with research, as well,” says Shah. “Now we’re going on this entrepreneurial journey together. It’s been exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah is a PhD candidate in ChemE’s Chemical Engineering Practice program. He got interested in the global imperative for cleaner water at a young age. His hometown of Surat is the heart of India’s textile industry. “Growing up, it wasn’t hard to see the dye-colored water flowing into your rivers and streams,” Shah says. “Playing a role in fostering positive change in water treatment fills me with a profound sense of purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah’s work, broadly, is to clean toxic chemicals called micropollutants from water in an efficient and sustainable manner. “It’s humanly impossible to turn a blind eye to our water problems,” he says, which can be categorized as accessibility, availability, and quality. Water problems are global and complex, not just because of the technological challenges but also sociopolitical ones, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufactured chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), or “forever chemicals,” are &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/forever-chemicals-called-pfas-show-your-food-clothes-and-home" target="_blank"&gt;in the news&lt;/a&gt; these days. PFAS, which go into making nonstick cookware and waterproof clothing, are just one of more than 10,000 such emerging contaminants that have leached into water streams. “These are extremely difficult to remove using existing systems because of their chemical diversity and low concentrations,” Shah says. “The concentrations are akin to dropping an aspirin tablet in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.” But no less toxic for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab at MIT, Shah is working with Devashish Gokhale, a fellow PhD student, and Patrick S. Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam (1911) Professor of Chemical Engineering, to commercialize an&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/zwitterionic-hydrogels-swiftly-eliminate-micropollutants-from-water-0109"&gt; innovative microparticle technology&lt;/a&gt;, hydroGel, to remove these micropollutants in an effective, facile, and sustainable manner. Hydrogels are a broad class of polymer materials that can hold large quantities of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our materials are like Boba beads. We are trying to save the world with our Boba beads,” says Shah with a laugh. “And we have functionalized these particles with tunable chemistries to target different micropollutants in a single unit operation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to its outsized environmental impact, industrial water is the first application Shah is targeting. Today, wastewater treatment emits&lt;a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/news/sewage-plants-overlooked-co2-source-20840"&gt; more than 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions&lt;/a&gt;, which is more than the shipping industry’s emissions, for example. The current state of the art for removing micropollutants in the industry is to use activated carbon filters. “[This technology] comes from coal, so it’s unsustainable,” Shah says. And the activated carbon filters are hard to reuse. “Our particles are reusable, theoretically infinitely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very excited to be able to take advantage of the mentorship we have from the Kavanaugh team to take this technology to its next inflection point, so that we are ready to go out in the market and start making a huge impact,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A dream community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah and Knappe have become adept at navigating the array of support and mentorship opportunities MIT has to offer. Shah worked with a small team of seasoned professionals in the water space from the MIT Venture Mentoring Service. “They’ve helped us every step of the way as we think about commercializing the technology,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah worked with MIT Sandbox, which provides a seed grant to help find the right product-market fit. He is also a fellow with the &lt;a href="https://legatum.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on entrepreneurship in global growth markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re exploring the potential for this technology and its application in a lot of different markets, including India. Because that’s close to my heart,” Shah says. “The Legatum community has been unique, where you can have those extremely hard conversations, confront yourself with those fears, and then talk it out with the group of fellows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab, or J-WAFS, has been an integral part of Shah’s journey with research and commercialization support through its Solutions Grant and a travel award to the Stockholm World Water Week in August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knappe has also taken advantage of many innovation programs, including MIT’s Blueprint by the Engine, which helps researchers explore commercial opportunities of their work, plus programs outside of MIT but with strong on-campus ties such as Nucleate Activator and Frequency Bio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was during one of these programs that he was inspired by two postdocs working in Bathe’s lab and spinning out biotech startups from their research, Floris Engelhardt and James Banal. Engelhardt helped spearhead&lt;a href="https://kanotherapeutics.com/platform/"&gt; Kano Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, and Banal launched&lt;a href="https://www.cache-dna.com/"&gt; Cache DNA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was passively absorbing and watching everything that they were going through and what they were excited about and challenged with. I still talk to them pretty regularly to this day,” Knappe says. “It’s been really great to have them as continual mentors, throughout my PhD and as I transition out of the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah says he is grateful not only for being selected for the Kavanaugh Fellowship but to MIT as a community. “MIT has been more than a dream come true,” he says. He will have the opportunity to explore a different side of the institution as he enters the MBA program at MIT Sloan School of Management this fall. Shah expects this program, along with his Kavanaugh training, will supply the skills he needs to scale the business so it can make a difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always keep coming back to the question ‘How does what I do matter to the person on the street?’ This guides me to look at the bigger picture, to contextualize my research to solving important problems,” Shah says. “So many great technologies are being worked on each day, but only a minuscule fraction make it to the market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knappe is equally dedicated to serving a larger purpose. “With the right infrastructure, between basic fundamental science, conducted in academia, funded by government, and then translated by companies, we can make products that could improve everyone’s life across the world,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past Kavanaugh Fellows are credited with spearheading commercial outfits that have indeed made a difference. This year’s fellows are poised to follow their lead. But first they will have that beer together to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most systems used to detect toxic gases in industrial or domestic settings can be used only once, or at best a few times. Now, researchers at MIT have developed a detector that could provide continuous monitoring for the presence of these gases, at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system combines two existing technologies, bringing them together in a way that preserves the advantages of each while avoiding their limitations. The team used a material called a metal-organic framework, or MOF, which is highly sensitive to tiny traces of gas but whose performance quickly degrades, and combined it with a polymer material that is highly durable and easier to process, but much less sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202312382" target="_blank"&gt;results are reported today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Materials&lt;/em&gt;, in a paper by MIT professors Aristide Gumyusenge, Mircea Dinca, Heather Kulik, and Jesus del Alamo, graduate student Heejung Roh, and postdocs Dong-Ha Kim, Yeongsu Cho, and Young-Moo Jo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly porous and with large surface areas, MOFs come in a variety of compositions. Some can be insulators, but the ones used for this work are highly electrically conductive. With their sponge-like form, they are effective at capturing molecules of various gases, and the sizes of their pores can be tailored to make them selective for particular kinds of gases. “If you are using them as a sensor, you can recognize if the gas is there if it has an effect on the resistivity of the MOF,” says Gumyusenge, the paper’s senior author and the Merton C. Flemings Career Development Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drawback for these materials’ use as detectors for gases is that they readily become saturated, and then can no longer detect and quantify new inputs. “That’s not what you want. You want to be able to detect and reuse,” Gumyusenge says. “So, we decided to use a polymer composite to achieve this reversibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a class of conductive polymers that Gumyusenge and his co-workers had &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssensors.3c01530" target="_blank"&gt;previously shown&lt;/a&gt; can respond to gases without permanently binding to them. “The polymer, even though it doesn’t have the high surface area that the MOFs do, will at least provide this recognize-and-release type of phenomenon,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team combined the polymers in a liquid solution along with the MOF material in powdered form, and deposited the mixture on a substrate, where they dry into a uniform, thin coating. By combining the polymer, with its quick detection capability, and the more sensitive MOFs, in a one-to-one ratio, he says, “suddenly we get a sensor that has both the high sensitivity we get from the MOF and the reversibility that is enabled by the presence of the polymer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material changes its electrical resistance when molecules of the gas are temporarily trapped in the material. These changes in resistance can be continuously monitored by simply attaching an ohmmeter to track the resistance over time. Gumyusenge and his students demonstrated the composite material’s ability to detect nitrogen dioxide, a toxic gas produced by many kinds of combustion, in a small lab-scale device. After 100 cycles of detection, the material was still maintaining its baseline performance within a margin of about 5 to 10 percent, demonstrating its long-term use potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, this material has far greater sensitivity than most presently used detectors for nitrogen dioxide, the team reports. This gas is often detected after the use of &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adm8680" target="_blank"&gt;stove ovens&lt;/a&gt;. And, with this gas recently linked to many asthma cases in the U.S., reliable detection in low concentrations is important. The team demonstrated that this new composite could detect, reversibly, the gas at concentrations as low as 2 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While their demonstration was specifically aimed at nitrogen dioxide, Gumyusenge says, “we can definitely tailor the chemistry to target other volatile molecules,” as long as they are small polar analytes, “which tend to be most of the toxic gases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides being compatible with a simple hand-held detector or a smoke-alarm type of device, one advantage of the material is that the polymer allows it to be deposited as an extremely thin uniform film, unlike regular MOFs, which are generally in an inefficient powder form. Because the films are so thin, there is little material needed and production material costs could be low; the processing methods could be typical of those used for industrial coating processes. “So, maybe the limiting factor will be scaling up the synthesis of the polymers, which we’ve been synthesizing in small amounts,” Gumyusenge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next steps will be to evaluate these in real-life settings,” he says. For example, the material could be applied as a coating on chimneys or exhaust pipes to continuously monitor gases through readings from an attached resistance monitoring device. In such settings, he says, “we need tests to check if we truly differentiate it from other potential contaminants that we might have overlooked in the lab setting. Let’s put the sensors out in real-world scenarios and see how they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported by the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium (MCSC), the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) at MIT, and the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Every year, beer breweries generate and discard thousands of tons of surplus yeast. Researchers from MIT and Georgia Tech have now come up with a way to repurpose that yeast to absorb lead from contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a process called biosorption, yeast can quickly absorb even trace amounts of lead and other heavy metals from water. The researchers showed that they could package the yeast inside hydrogel capsules to create a filter that removes lead from water. Because the yeast cells are encapsulated, they can be easily removed from the water once it’s ready to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have the hydrogel surrounding the free yeast that exists in the center, and this is porous enough to let water come in, interact with yeast as if they were freely moving in water, and then come out clean,” says Patricia Stathatou, a former postdoc at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms, who is now a research scientist at Georgia Tech and an incoming assistant professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. “The fact that the yeast themselves are bio-based, benign, and biodegradable is a significant advantage over traditional technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers envision that this process could be used to filter drinking water coming out of a faucet in homes, or scaled up to treat large quantities of water at treatment plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT graduate student Devashish Gokhale and Stathatou&amp;nbsp;are the lead authors of the study, which &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/su/d4su00052h" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;RSC Sustainability&lt;/em&gt;. Patrick Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT, is the senior author of the paper, and Christos Athanasiou, an assistant professor of aerospace engineering at Georgia Tech and a former visiting scholar at MIT, is also an author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorbing lead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study builds on work that Stathatou and Athanasiou began in 2021, when Athanasiou was a visiting scholar at MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms. That year, they calculated that waste yeast discarded from a single brewery in Boston would be enough to treat the city’s entire water supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through biosorption, a process that is not fully understood, yeast cells can bind to and absorb heavy metal ions, even at challenging initial concentrations below 1 part per million. The MIT team found that this process could effectively decontaminate water with low concentrations of lead. However, one key obstacle remained, which was how to remove yeast from the water after they absorb the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a serendipitous coincidence, Stathatou and Athanasiou happened to present their research at the AIChE Annual Meeting in Boston in 2021, where Gokhale, a student in Doyle’s lab, was presenting his own research on using hydrogels to capture micropollutants in water. The two sets of researchers decided to join forces and explore whether the yeast-based strategy could be easier to scale up if the yeast were encapsulated in hydrogels developed by Gokhale and Doyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we decided to do was make these hollow capsules — something like a multivitamin pill, but instead of filling them up with vitamins, we fill them up with yeast cells,” Gokhale says. “These capsules are porous, so the water can go into the capsules and the yeast are able to bind all of that lead, but the yeast themselves can’t escape into the water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capsules are made from a polymer called polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is widely used in medical applications. To form the capsules, the researchers suspend freeze-dried yeast in water, then mix them with the polymer subunits. When UV light is shone on the mixture, the polymers link together to form capsules with yeast trapped inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each capsule is about half a millimeter in diameter. Because the hydrogels are very thin and porous, water can easily pass through and encounter the yeast inside, while the yeast remain trapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers showed that the encapsulated yeast could remove trace lead from water just as rapidly as the unencapsulated yeast from Stathatou and Athanasiou’s original 2021 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Athanasiou, the researchers tested the mechanical stability of the hydrogel capsules and found that the capsules and the yeast inside can withstand forces similar to those generated by water running from a faucet. They also calculated that the yeast-laden capsules should be able to withstand forces generated by flows in water treatment plants serving several hundred residences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lack of mechanical robustness is a common cause of failure of previous attempts to scale-up biosorption using immobilized cells; in our work we wanted to make sure that this aspect is thoroughly addressed from the very beginning to ensure scalability,” Athanasiou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After assessing the mechanical robustness of the yeast-laden capsules, the researchers constructed a proof-of-concept packed-bed biofilter, capable of treating trace lead-contaminated water and meeting U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking water guidelines while operating continuously for 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process would likely consume less energy than existing physicochemical processes for removing trace inorganic compounds from water, such as precipitation and membrane filtration, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, rooted in circular economy principles, could minimize waste and environmental impact while also fostering economic opportunities within local communities. Although numerous lead contamination incidents have been reported in various locations in the United States, this approach could have an especially significant impact in low-income areas that have historically faced environmental pollution and limited access to clean water, and may not be able to afford other ways to remediate it, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that there’s an interesting environmental justice aspect to this, especially when you start with something as low-cost and sustainable as yeast, which is essentially available anywhere,” Gokhale says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now exploring strategies for recycling and replacing the yeast once they’re used up, and trying to calculate how often that will need to occur. They also hope to investigate whether they could use feedstocks derived from biomass to make the hydrogels, instead of fossil-fuel-based polymers, and whether the yeast can be used to capture other types of contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moving forward, this is a technology that can be evolved to target other trace contaminants of emerging concern, such as PFAS or even microplastics,” Stathatou says. “We really view this as an example with a lot of potential applications in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Rasikbhai L. Meswani Fellowship for Water Solutions, the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), and the Renewable Bioproducts Institute at Georgia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Engineers at MIT, Nanyang Technological University, and several companies have developed a compact and inexpensive technology for detecting and measuring lead concentrations in water, potentially enabling a significant advance in tackling this persistent global health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization estimates that 240 million people worldwide are exposed to drinking water that contains unsafe amounts of toxic lead, which can affect brain development in children, cause birth defects, and produce a variety of neurological, cardiac, and other damaging effects. In the United States alone, an estimated 10 million households still get drinking water delivered through lead pipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s an unaddressed public health crisis that leads to over 1 million deaths annually,” says Jia Xu Brian Sia, an MIT postdoc and the senior author of the paper describing the new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But testing for lead in water requires expensive, cumbersome equipment and typically requires days to get results. Or, it uses simple test strips that simply reveal a yes-or-no answer about the presence of lead but no information about its concentration. Current EPA regulations require drinking water to contain no more that 15 parts per billion of lead, a concentration so low it is difficult to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system, which could be ready for commercial deployment within two or three years, could detect lead concentrations as low as 1 part per billion, with high accuracy, using a simple chip-based detector housed in a handheld device. The technology gives nearly instant quantitative measurements and requires just a droplet of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are described in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47938-6" target="_blank"&gt;paper appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, by Sia, MIT graduate student and lead author Luigi Ranno, Professor Juejun Hu, and 12 others at MIT and other institutions in academia and industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team set out to find a simple detection method based on the use of photonic chips, which use light to perform measurements. The challenging part was finding a way to attach to the photonic chip surface certain ring-shaped molecules known as crown ethers, which can capture specific ions such as lead. After years of effort, they were able to achieve that attachment via a chemical process known as Fischer esterification. “That is one of the essential breakthroughs we have made in this technology,” Sia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In testing the new chip, the researchers showed that it can detect lead in water at concentrations as low as one part per billion. At much higher concentrations, which may be relevant for testing environmental contamination such as mine tailings, the accuracy is within 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device works in water with varying levels of acidity, ranging from pH values of 6 to 8, “which covers most environmental samples,” Sia says. They have tested the device with seawater as well as tap water, and verified the accuracy of the measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to achieve such levels of accuracy, current testing requires a device called an inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometer. “These setups can be big and expensive,” Sia says. The sample processing can take days and requires experienced technical personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the new chip system they developed is “the core part of the innovation,” Ranno says, further work will be needed to develop this into an integrated, handheld device for practical use. “For making an actual product, you would need to package it into a usable form factor,” he explains. This would involve having a small chip-based laser coupled to the photonic chip. “It’s a matter of mechanical design, some optical design, some chemistry, and figuring out the supply chain,” he says. While that takes time, he says, the underlying concepts are straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system can be adapted to detect other similar contaminants in water, including cadmium, copper, lithium, barium, cesium, and radium, Ranno says. The device could be used with simple cartridges that can be swapped out to detect different elements, each using slightly different crown ethers that can bind to a specific ion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s this problem that people don’t measure their water enough, especially in the developing countries,” Ranno says. “And that’s because they need to collect the water, prepare the sample, and bring it to these huge instruments that are extremely expensive.” Instead, “having this handheld device, something compact that even untrained personnel can just bring to the source for on-site monitoring, at low costs,” could make regular, ongoing widespread testing feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hu, who is the John F. Elliott Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, says, “I’m hoping this will be quickly implemented, so we can benefit human society. This is a good example of a technology coming from a lab innovation where it may actually make a very tangible impact on society, which is of course very fulfilling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this study can be extended to simultaneous detection of multiple metal elements, especially the presently concerning radioactive elements, its potential would be immense,” says Hou Wang, an associate professor of environmental science and engineering at Hunan University in China, who was not associated with this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang adds, “This research has engineered a sensor capable of instantaneously detecting lead concentration in water. This can be utilized in real-time to monitor the lead pollution concentration in wastewater discharged from industries such as battery manufacturing and lead smelting, facilitating the establishment of industrial wastewater monitoring systems. I think the innovative aspects and developmental potential of this research are quite commendable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang Qian, a principal research scientist at A*STAR’s Institute of Materials Research in Singapore, who also was not affiliated with this work, says, “The ability for the pervasive, portable, and quantitative detection of lead has proved to be challenging primarily due to cost concerns. This work demonstrates the potential to do so in a highly integrated form factor and is compatible with large-scale, low-cost manufacturing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team included researchers at MIT, at Nanyang Technological University and Temasek Laboratories in Singapore, at the University of Southampton in the U.K., and at companies Fingate Technologies, in Singapore, and Vulcan Photonics, headquartered in Malaysia. The work used facilities at MIT.nano, the Harvard University Center for Nanoscale Systems, NTU’s Center for Micro- and Nano-Electronics, and the Nanyang Nanofabrication Center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Study: Heavy snowfall and rain may contribute to some earthquakes</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When scientists look for an earthquake’s cause, their search often starts underground. As centuries of seismic studies have made clear, it’s the collision of tectonic plates and the movement of subsurface faults and fissures that primarily trigger a temblor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But MIT scientists have now found that certain weather events may also play a role in setting off some quakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado1469" target="_blank"&gt;study appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers report that episodes of heavy snowfall and rain likely contributed to a swarm of earthquakes over the past several years in northern Japan. The study is the first to show that climate conditions could initiate some quakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see that snowfall and other environmental loading at the surface impacts the stress state underground, and the timing of intense precipitation events is well-correlated with the start of this earthquake swarm,” says study author William Frank, an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). “So, climate obviously has an impact on the response of the solid earth, and part of that response is earthquakes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study focuses on a series of ongoing earthquakes in Japan’s Noto Peninsula. The team discovered that seismic activity in the region is surprisingly synchronized with certain changes in underground pressure, and that those changes are influenced by seasonal patterns of snowfall and precipitation. The scientists suspect that this new connection between quakes and climate may not be unique to Japan and could play a role in shaking up other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, they predict that the climate’s influence on earthquakes could be more pronounced with global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we’re going into a climate that’s changing, with more extreme precipitation events, and we expect a redistribution of water in the atmosphere, oceans, and continents, that will change how the Earth’s crust is loaded,” Frank adds. “That will have an impact for sure, and it’s a link we could further explore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author is former MIT research associate Qing-Yu Wang (now at Grenoble Alpes University), and also includes EAPS postdoc Xin Cui, Yang Lu of the University of Vienna, Takashi Hirose of Tohoku University, and Kazushige Obara of the University of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seismic speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since late 2020, hundreds of small earthquakes have shaken up Japan’s Noto Peninsula — a finger of land that curves north from the country’s main island into the Sea of Japan. Unlike a typical earthquake sequence, which begins as a main shock that gives way to a series of aftershocks before dying out, Noto’s seismic activity is an “earthquake swarm” — a pattern of multiple, ongoing quakes with no obvious main shock, or seismic trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team, along with their colleagues in Japan, aimed to spot any patterns in the swarm that would explain the persistent quakes. They started by looking through the Japanese Meteorological Agency’s catalog of earthquakes that provides data on seismic activity throughout the country over time. They focused on quakes in the Noto Peninsula over the last 11 years, during which the region has experienced episodic earthquake activity, including the most recent swarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With seismic data from the catalog, the team counted the number of seismic events that occurred in the region over time, and found that the timing of quakes prior to 2020 appeared sporadic and unrelated, compared to late 2020, when earthquakes grew more intense and clustered in time, signaling the start of the swarm, with quakes that are correlated in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then looked to a second dataset of seismic measurements taken by monitoring stations over the same 11-year period. Each station continuously records any displacement, or local shaking that occurs. The shaking from one station to another can give scientists an idea of how fast a seismic wave travels between stations. This “seismic velocity” is related to the structure of the Earth through which the seismic wave is traveling.&amp;nbsp;Wang&amp;nbsp;used the station measurements to calculate the seismic velocity between every station in and around Noto over the last 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers generated an evolving picture of seismic velocity beneath the Noto Peninsula and observed a surprising pattern: In 2020, around when the earthquake swarm is thought to have begun, changes in seismic velocity appeared to be synchronized with the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We then had to explain why we were observing this seasonal variation,” Frank says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snow pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wondered whether environmental changes from season to season could influence the underlying structure of the Earth in a way that would set off an earthquake swarm. Specifically, they looked at how seasonal precipitation would affect the underground “pore fluid pressure” — the amount of pressure that fluids in the Earth’s cracks and fissures exert within the bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it rains or snows, that adds weight, which increases pore pressure, which allows seismic waves to travel through slower,” Frank explains. “When all that weight is removed, through evaporation or runoff, all of a sudden, that pore pressure decreases and seismic waves are&amp;nbsp;faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang and Cui developed a hydromechanical model of the Noto Peninsula to simulate the underlying pore pressure over the last 11 years in response to seasonal changes in precipitation. They fed into the model meteorological data from this same period, including measurements of daily snow, rainfall, and sea-level changes. From their model, they were able to track changes in excess pore pressure beneath the Noto Peninsula, before and during the earthquake swarm. They then compared this timeline of evolving pore pressure with their evolving picture of seismic velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had seismic velocity observations, and we had the model of excess pore pressure, and when we overlapped them, we saw they just fit extremely well,” Frank says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, they found that when they included snowfall data, and especially, extreme snowfall events, the fit between the model and observations was stronger than if they only considered rainfall and other events. In other words, the ongoing earthquake swarm that Noto residents have been experiencing can be explained in part by seasonal precipitation, and particularly, heavy snowfall events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can see that the timing of these earthquakes lines up extremely well with multiple times where we see intense snowfall,” Frank says. “It’s&amp;nbsp;well-correlated with earthquake activity. And we think there’s a physical link between the two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suspect that heavy snowfall and similar extreme precipitation could play a role in earthquakes elsewhere, though they emphasize that the primary trigger will always originate underground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we first want to understand how earthquakes work, we look to plate tectonics, because that is and will always be the number one reason why an earthquake happens,” Frank says. “But, what are the other things that could affect when and how an earthquake happens? That’s when you start to go to second-order controlling factors, and the climate is obviously one of those.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) has advanced interdisciplinary research aimed at solving the world's most pressing water and food security challenges to meet human needs. In 2017, J-WAFS established the Rasikbhai L. Meswani Water Solutions Fellowship and the J-WAFS Graduate Student Fellowship. These fellowships provide support to outstanding MIT graduate students who are pursuing research that has the potential to improve water and food systems around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, J-WAFS awarded the 2024-25 fellowships to Jonathan Bessette and Akash Ball, two MIT PhD students dedicated to addressing water scarcity by enhancing desalination and purification processes. This work is of important relevance since the world's freshwater supply has been steadily depleting due to the effects of climate change. In fact, one-third of the global population lacks access to safe drinking water. Bessette and Ball are focused on designing innovative solutions to enhance the resilience and sustainability of global water systems. To support their endeavors, J-WAFS will provide each recipient with funding for one academic semester for continued research and related activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This year, we received many strong fellowship applications,” says J-WAFS executive director Renee J. Robins. “Bessette and Ball both stood out, even in a very competitive pool of candidates. The award of the J-WAFS fellowships to these two students underscores our confidence in their potential to bring transformative solutions to global water challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024-25 Rasikbhai L. Meswani Fellowship for Water Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rasikbhai L. Meswani Fellowship for Water Solutions is a doctoral fellowship for students pursuing research related to water and water supply at MIT. The fellowship is made possible by Elina and Nikhil Meswani and family.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Bessette is a doctoral student in the Global Engineering and Research (GEAR) Center within the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, advised by Professor Amos Winter. His research is focused on water treatment systems for the developing world, mainly desalination, or the process in which salts are removed from water. Currently, Bessette is working on designing and constructing a low-cost, deployable, community-scale desalination system for humanitarian crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater often serves as the sole water source, despite its common salinity issues. Many remote and developing areas lack reliable centralized power and water systems, making brackish groundwater desalination a vital, sustainable solution for global water scarcity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An overlooked need for desalination is inland groundwater aquifers, rather than in coastal areas,” says Bessette. “This is because much of the population lives far enough from a coast that seawater desalination could never reach them. My work involves designing low-cost, sustainable, renewable-powered desalination technologies for highly constrained situations, such as drinking water for remote communities,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this goal, Bessette developed a batteryless, renewable electrodialysis desalination system. The technology is energy-efficient, conserves water, and is particularly suited for challenging environments, as it is decentralized and sustainable. The system offers significant advantages over the conventional reverse osmosis method, especially in terms of reduced energy consumption for treating brackish water. Highlighting Bessette’s capacity for engineering insight, his advisor noted the “simple and elegant solution” that Bessette and a staff engineer, Shane Pratt, devised that negated the need for the system to have large batteries. Bessette is now focusing on simplifying the system’s architecture to make it more reliable and cost-effective for deployment in remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in upstate New York, Bessette completed a bachelor's degree at the State University of New York at Buffalo. As an undergrad, he taught middle and high school students in low-income areas of Buffalo about engineering and sustainability. However, he cited his junior-year travel to India and his experience there measuring water contaminants in rural sites as cementing his dedication to a career addressing food, water, and sanitation challenges. In addition to his doctoral research, his commitment to these goals is further evidenced by another project he is pursuing, funded by a J-WAFS India grant, that uses low-cost, remote sensors to better understand water fetching practices. Bessette is conducting this work with fellow MIT student Gokul Sampath in order to help families in rural India gain access to safe drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024-25 J-WAFS Graduate Student Fellowship for Water and Food Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J-WAFS Graduate Student Fellowship is supported by the &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/DirectSponsoredResearch" target="_blank"&gt;J-WAFS Research Affiliate Program&lt;/a&gt;, which offers companies the opportunity to engage with MIT on water and food research. Current fellowship support was provided by two J-WAFS Research Affiliates: &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/xylem" target="_blank"&gt;Xylem&lt;/a&gt;, a leading U.S.-based provider of water treatment and infrastructure solutions, and &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/goaigua" target="_blank"&gt;GoAigua&lt;/a&gt;, a Spanish company at the forefront of digital transformation in the water industry through innovative solutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akash Ball is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering, advised by Professor Heather Kulik. His research focuses on the computational discovery of novel functional materials for energy-efficient ion separation membranes with high selectivity. Advanced membranes like these are increasingly needed for applications such as water desalination, battery recycling, and removal of heavy metals from industrial wastewater.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Climate change, water pollution, and scarce freshwater reserves cause severe water distress for about 4 billion people annually, with 2 billion in India and China’s semiarid regions,” Ball notes. “One potential solution to this global water predicament is the desalination of seawater, since seawater accounts for 97 percent of all water on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several commercial reverse osmosis membranes are currently available, these membranes suffer several problems, like slow water permeation, permeability-selectivity trade-off, and high fabrication costs. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials that are promising candidates for highly selective ion separation with fast water transport due to high surface area, the presence of different pore windows, and the tunability of chemical functionality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Kulik lab, Ball is developing a systematic understanding of how MOF chemistry and pore geometry affect water transport and ion rejection rates. By the end of his PhD, Ball plans to identify existing, best-performing MOFs with unparalleled water uptake using machine learning models, propose novel hypothetical MOFs tailored to specific ion separations from water, and discover experimental design rules that enable the synthesis of next-generation membranes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball’s advisor praised the creativity he brings to his research, and his leadership skills that benefit her whole lab. Before coming to MIT, Ball obtained a master’s degree in chemical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay and a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from Jadavpur University in India. During a research internship at IIT Bombay in 2018, he worked on developing a technology for in situ arsenic detection in water. Like Bessette, he noted the impact of this prior research experience on his interest in global water challenges, along with his personal experience growing up in an area in India where access to safe drinking water was not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
