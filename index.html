                  This website is my personal selection of RSS feeds from MIT that I find interesting. It provides access
                  to various news, research, and events from a wide range of topics coming out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT).
                </p>
                <p class="card-text border border-3 fw-semibold p-2">
                  My objective on this page is to present these curated feeds in an intuitive and user-friendly format, ensuring that
                   you can effortlessly browse back and forth through the content. Hopefully you digest, learn, and engage with this thought-provoking material.
                   On my site you will find articles about <a href="rss-feed-1.html">Neurology &amp; Cognitive Sciences</a>. I chose this feed because my grandma had a brain aneurysm and was operated on by my one of the worlds
                   leading neurologist when brain surgery for aneurysms was new, the operation took over 8 hours. I know a couple neurologist so I have seen the level of commitment and education that goes into their job. I find it interesting how
                   much influence and reach the field of neurology has. Anything from strokes to autism to brain tumors.
                   Next I chose <a href="rss-feed-2.html">Social Sciences</a> because human behavior interest me greatly. What humans value and find important, influences the world so much, for good and bad. Our ethics as individuals and as a
                   a society will produce the world that our children and grandchildren and future generations will inherit.
                   In addition I chose <a href="rss-feed-3.html"> Poverty Research &amp; Alleviation</a> because so much of the world's problems would be solved if we eliminated poverty. Poverty creates desperation and because of that desperation; crime rates, in turn go up.
                   We could lower crime rates if we eliminated poverty by meeting people's basic needs and equipping people with what they need to meet their own needs. There are no easy answers so I am always interested
                   in learning more about how we can build a better and more equitable world.
                   Lastly I chose to share <a href="rss-feed-4.html">Food &amp; Water Security</a> feed because water is such a fundamental and necessary part of life and also one of the highest profit margins. To think that so many people do not
                   have access to the water they need is mind-boggling. I am interested in learning about the ways the world is at risk of losing our vital water sources and what we can do to help. I hope as you navigate through my page you find something you are interested in learning more about.

                My name is Cami Carstens and I am a student taking Web Technologies at Rankin Technical Institute in Spring 2025. I am interested in technology; up to date and current research.
               I enjoy learning from a well respected institute like MIT that I know is science backed. I also love to read, cook, and practice coding with my cats on my lap or cuddled up next me.
